<h1>Bathing Part 2</h1>
<p>
  In this lesson, we’ll turn the water on to help Shadow get used to it in the
  bath or shower. You’ll be building on the work you did previously and continue
  using treats or a stuffed food toy so it remains a fun activity for him. We’ll
  also introduce some grooming first to get Shadow used to this part of bath
  time. If Shadow isn’t used to being brushed yet, pop back to the library and
  work on that separately.
</p>
<h4>You will need</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Stuffed Kong toy</li>
  <li>Licky Mat</li>
  <li>Non-slip mat</li>
  <li>Old towel</li>
  <li>Soft brush</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Brush Shadow gently before giving him a bath to get any loose dirt or dead
    coat out.
  </li>
  <li>
    Have your food stuffed toy ready, like a licky mat with paste on or a Kong
    stuffed with something yummy. This will help Shadow associate the bath or
    shower with something nice and tasty.
  </li>
  <li>
    Put a non-slip bath mat or old towel inside the bath (or sink if your pup is
    small enough!).
  </li>
  <li>
    Turn the shower or tap on while making sure it’s not focused on Shadow, but
    is aimed at the floor of the sink or bath.
  </li>
  <li>
    For now, all we want is just a little bit of water at the bottom of the
    bath, or a trickle of water while Shadow is busy enjoying his toy or treats.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you’re giving him treats, break them up really small but feed them
    frequently to keep his interest high.
  </li>
  <li>
    That’s it for now! Time to take a break, dry off and repeat this in a few
    days time.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Tips</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Practise this first stage several times so Shadow gets used to going in the
    bath and thinks of it as a fun place to be.
  </li>
  <li>
    The more you rebuild positive associations to going in the bath, the easier
    the next stage will be, as he will be more used to the water.
  </li>
</ul>
