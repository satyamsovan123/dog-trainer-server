<h1>Traffic Sounds Habituation</h1>
<p>
  Shadow will need to be taught that traffic noises aren’t so scary. Not even us
  humans are great fans of that, to be fair, but it’s important to teach puppies
  that it’s nothing to worry about. Hopefully, you’ve already introduced them to
  weather and firework noises. Did they do ok? If not, pop back to the library
  and review some of the previous lessons.
</p>
<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Clips or sounds of traffic noises</li>
  <li>Puppy's meal</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Put down Shadow’s food, or set him up with a food puzzle game.</li>
  <li>
    Play the sound effect at a very low level while he is eating or playing.
  </li>
  <li>Continue playing it for 5 minutes after Shadow has finished.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    If Shadow reacts at all, it means the sounds are way too loud, and you
    should probably turn them down.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don’t react to the sounds yourself to show Shadow everything is going well.
  </li>
  <li>
    Doing this exercise at different times is important to help Shadow get used
    to hearing unpredictable sounds.
  </li>
  <li>Each day, you can make the sounds a little louder.</li>
  <li>
    If Shadow ever looks worried, make sure to go back a few steps, and build up
    slowly.
  </li>
</ul>
