<h1>A new home</h1>
<p>
  Now that Shadow is getting familiar with his new home, it's time for him to
  explore a bit more.
</p>
<p>Here's a few tips for how to help him get there:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Make sure the rooms Shadow is going to have access to are safe. This means
    tidying up, and getting rid of wires, poisonous plants, or other hazards
    that can get him into a pickle. Remember that German Shepherd Dog puppies
    investigate things with their mouths, not just eyes and noses!
  </li>
  <li>
    If you have a garden, ensure it has secure fencing and look for potential
    escape routes and hazards!
  </li>
  <li>
    Decide what rooms Shadow is going to be allowed into. This might be the
    whole house, or you may want certain rooms to be off-limits. These can be
    closed off with baby gates.
  </li>
  <li>
    Let Shadow explore the house in his own time under your supervision. Never
    push him into investigating anything. If he isn't too keen on something -
    this should all be done at his own speed.
  </li>
  <li>
    In each room (and garden), just sit quietly for a couple of minutes. Let
    Shadow get used to his new home and allow him to explore the outdoor space,
    and experience the sights, sounds, and scents of his new area. You can spend
    as long as you want doing this really; every minute is building Shadow's
    confidence.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Talk to him all the time in a gentle quiet voice to help give him even more of
  a confidence boost. This also helps in building the bond between you.
