<h1>Bathing Part 1</h1>
<p>
  Puppies are cute, but messy! For times when that infatuating fresh-puppy smell
  gets clouded and overshadowed with the smell of mud and hints of poo, it’ll be
  helpful to know how to bathe your puppy. The first stage of how to give
  puppies a bath is getting them used to the bath area. That’s what we’re
  focusing on for this lesson.

<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Stuffed Kong toy</li>
  <li>Non-slip mat</li>
  <li>Old towel</li>
  <li>Licky Mat</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Have your food toy ready, like a likkimat with some yummy paste on or a Kong
    stuffed with something delicious. This will help Shadow associate the bath
    or shower (or sink!) with something nice and tasty.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure you have a non-slip bath mat or an old towel at the bottom of the
    bath or shower so that Shadow won’t slip.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pop Shadow in the tub or shower while you sit nearby and give them the
    stuffed food toy or scatter some treats for them to eat.
  </li>
  <li>
    Let Shadow enjoy the toy and treats, and when they’re finished, get him out.
    No need to get any water out just yet.
  </li>

    </li>
    <li>Practise this several times before you go on to the next step.</li>
