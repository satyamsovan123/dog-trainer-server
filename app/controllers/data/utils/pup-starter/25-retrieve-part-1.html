<h1>Retrieve Part 1</h1>

<p>
  Games you can play with Shadow are going to be key parts of building your
  relationship and having fun together.
</p>

<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Toys</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    While you are interacting with Shadow, roll or gently throw his toy a little
    bit away from him and see what he does.
  </li>
  <li>Shadow will probably follow it and maybe pick it up.</li>
  <li>If he does, encourage him to come back to you with it.</li>
  <li>
    When he does (even if he only comes a little way back) either throw it again
    (if he drops it) or swap it for a treat (or another toy) and then throw it
    again.
  </li>
  <li>Repeat this five times.</li>
  <li>Introduce this into your play times.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    If Shadow doesn’t chase the toy, it's okay, he will get the fun of it soon.
    Find a more interesting toy and try again later. Squeaky toys or ones that
    are softer to carry might work better.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure you are sounding happy and chirpy when you encourage Shadow to
    come back!
  </li>
  <li>
    If he doesn’t come back to you, don’t chase him or try to grab the toy -
    instead move away from him. Shadow is more likely to come to you to show you
    what he has got!
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless Shadow drops the toy, always swap it for a treat or another similar
    toy - you don’t want to encourage him to run away from you when he has a
    ‘prize’ you might not want him to have. Like your shoes!
  </li>
</ul>
