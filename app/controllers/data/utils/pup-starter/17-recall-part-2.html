<h1>Recall - Part 2</h1>

<p>
  This lesson will teach Shadow to come to you when you use a cue word. By now,
  Shadow should be looking at you when you say his name, and he may have started
  to come to you when he hears it. If you're not quite there yet, pop back to
  the previous Recall lesson which you can find in the library, and practice a
  little on that before moving ahead.

<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft treats</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Say Shadow’s name so he looks at you.</li>
  <li>Drop a treat on the floor beside you when he does.</li>
  <li>Do this once again.</li>
  <li>
    After you’ve done that successfully twice, say Shadow’s name exactly as
    before, but this time don’t drop the treat.
  </li>
  <li>
    As he is coming to you, say the cue word (e.g. “come” or “here”), to link
    the cue word with the action.
  </li>
  <li>Reward him with a treat from your hand when Shadow gets to you.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Make sure there are no distractions. It’s difficult for German Shepherd Dog
    puppies to concentrate when there are other things going on.
  </li>
  <li>Only use the cue word when Shadow is coming towards you, not before.</li>
  <li>
    Don’t touch him or try to get hold of them yet. This task is purely about
    coming to you for a reward.
  </li>
  <li>If he doesn’t come to you, get a tastier, smellier treat.</li>
  <li>
    Do this task when you know Shadow is hungry. Not straight after mealtime.
  </li>
</ul>
