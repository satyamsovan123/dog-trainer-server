<h1>Muffin Tin Puzzle for Dogs</h1>

<p>
  This Muffin Tin Puzzle is easy to set up, and we can pretty much guarantee
  that Shadow (and you) will have a great time playing with it.
</p>
<p>
  When Shadow uses his nose to find treats, it's excellent mental stimulation
  and a fantastic opportunity for Shadow to have loads of new experiences like
  moving things around all kinds of different materials and hearing new, funny
  noises.
</p>
<h2>Here's what you'll need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A metal muffin tin.</li>
  <li>Six tennis balls.</li>
  <li>Small tasty treats that you know Shadow loves.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two ways to play this game. Double the fun!</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    The first is to place the tin upside down on a non-slip floor or rug. Then,
    sprinkle the treats between the raised muffin moulds so that Shadow has to
    sniff, nose, or paw them out.
  </li>
  <li>
    The second way to play is to set the tin the right way up, and place treats
    or part of Shadow's meal into the pans, with a tennis ball topping each one
    off. This time, Shadow will have to nose, nudge, or paw the balls from the
    tray to reveal the treats.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Either way, Shadow will be filled with excitement, and you with joy as you see
  him digging in so happily.
</p>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Start out quite easy and point out where the treats are to give Shadow some
    help. He will get the hang of it soon enough.
  </li>
  <li>
    As the game gets harder, use higher-value treats so that Shadow can smell
    them easily and make the game an even yummier experience.
  </li>
</ul>
