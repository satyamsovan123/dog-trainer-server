<h1>Different Surfaces</h1>

<p>
  Did you know that puppies learn through their feet? By giving Shadow different
  surfaces to walk on, you can help his development and build his confidence
  tremendously, so that he is ready to take on the world. Don't worry if it
  takes Shadow a little time to get comfortable walking on different surfaces.
  It's normal for German Shepherd Dogs to take a little time with this - welcome
  mats aren't necessarily the smoothest thing to walk on! Just let him explore
  in his own time.
</p>
<p>
  Before you start, make sure everything you use for this task is safe - this
  means no slippery or wobbly surfaces. You may also want to do this lesson in
  the room where Shadow is the most confident and spends most of his time during
  the day.

<ol>
  <li>
    First, set up 3 different surfaces on the floor. These can be anything from
    bubble wrap, a towel, a tile, carpet, or a metal tray.
  </li>
  <li>
    Let Shadow explore them in any way he wants to for about 15 minutes - or for
    as long as he feels happy doing so. You might see him sniff, walk on them,
    or even pick them up. Anything goes! It's simply his way of getting familiar
    with them.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some pups are confident from the start and can't wait to explore, while
    others can take more time. Either way Shadow goes is fine! Just keep being
    patient, like you have been doing so well already. Just so you know, often
    the puppies that take the longest time to get confident exploring are the
    ones that are learning the most after all.

<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    This exercise is all about gaining confidence, so feel confident in letting
    Shadow do whatever he wants with whatever you put in front of him. He will
    know what's best to do!
  </li>
  <li>Stay close to Shadow so he gets confidence from you being there.</li>
  <li>
    For the next 2 weeks, let Shadow explore 3 new surfaces or things to walk on
    per week. This will help him build confidence in a variety of situations.
  </li>
</ul>
