<h1>Grooming Part 1</h1>

<p>
  German Shepherd Dogs love the great outdoors so much that they often bring
  some of it back home with them in their coat. This means you might be spending
  quite a lot of time grooming! Don't worry, we'll make sure this is a good
  experience for you both.
</p>

<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Soft Brush</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Give Shadow a chance to see and sniff the brush, so he knows it’s nothing to
    worry about.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stroke Shadow gently with your hand at first, and then run the brush down
    the side of his neck and shoulders.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stay away from sensitive areas like his paws, stomach, and face for now.
  </li>
  <li>After each few brush strokes, give Shadow a treat.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Make sure the brush is soft enough that it is comfortable for Shadow, but
    still stiff enough to get through stubborn knots in his coat.
  </li>
  <li>
    It’s best to do this while Shadow is relaxed beside you or on your lap.
    Let's not make a big thing of it or try to restrain him as you want him to
    feel happy, relaxed, and make grooming and handling a positive experience
    overall.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure everyone in the family knows to handle and interact with Shadow
    gently!
  </li>
  <li>
    Try getting him used to you running your hands down his more sensitive areas
    after he is comfortable being brushed elsewhere. Gotta get to those spots
    someday!
  </li>
</ul>
