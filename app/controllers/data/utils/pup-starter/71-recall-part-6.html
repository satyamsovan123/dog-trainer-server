<h1>Recall Part 6</h1>
<p>
  Happy days ahead. Very soon you’ll be heading outside with Shadow if you
  haven't already. Of course, being able to call him back when you need to will
  be pretty vital. If your recall isn’t quite there yet, pop back to the library
  for a refresh of previous lessons. Let’s start training!
</p>

<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Treat pouch</li>
  <li>Harness</li>
  <li>2m Training Lead</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Put the harness and lead on Shadow, and practice a few "recalls" on the lead
    in the garden, just as you’ve done before.
  </li>
  <li>Reward Shadow when he comes to you.</li>
  <li>
    Now for the big moment. Take the lead off, and practice "recalls" without
    the lead.
  </li>
  <li>
    Well done! Reward Shadow when he comes to you. Keep going about 6 more times
    and build up the distance little by little.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Start with no distractions to make sure Shadow can focus as best as he can.
  </li>
  <li>
    No matter what is happening, try to practice everywhere in the garden!
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure Shadow is looking at you before you ask him to come to you - this
    is a good way to see if he is listening!
  </li>
  <li>
    Rule of thumb: Only say the cue word once! That way, Shadow will understand
    that the only time he gets a reward is if he comes over the first time you
    ask.
  </li>
</ul>
