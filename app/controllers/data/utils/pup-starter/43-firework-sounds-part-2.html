<h1>Firework Sounds Part 2</h1>
<p>
  Teaching Shadow to get used to loud and potentially scary sounds is very
  important. This lesson focuses on getting Shadow used to Firework sounds. We
  ideally want to build these sound habituation lessons up slowly to give Shadow
  the best chance of success. If he hasn't got used to quiet storm sounds with
  you yet, it's worth popping back over that in the library where you’ll find
  all of the sound habituation lessons.

<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Clips or sounds of fireworks</li>
  <li>Puppy's meal</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Get the fireworks sound effect ready to start at a low volume.</li>
  <li>Remember that Shadow’s hearing is better than yours!</li>
  <li>At first, you want it so quiet that he doesn’t react at all.</li>
  <li>Put down Shadow’s food.</li>
  <li>Play the effect very quietly while he is eating.</li>
  <li>
    Let the sound continue for 5 minutes more after Shadow has finished his
    meal.
  </li>
  <li>Repeat this every day at different times.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If Shadow reacts at all, it means the sound is too loud.</li>
  <li>
    Don’t react to the sounds yourself in order to help Shadow know he is safe.
  </li>
  <li>If Shadow ever looks worried, go back a few steps to the beginning!</li>
</ul>
