<h1>Vaccum Cleaner Sounds</h1>
<ol>
  <li>
    In this lesson, we’ll be teaching Shadow that the vacuum cleaner makes a
    noise when it moves.
  </li>
  <li>
    If Shadow isn’t comfortable with the vacuum cleaner moving around, pop back
    to the library and review the previous lessons.
  </li>
  <li>
    Vacuum cleaners can be strange and scary for puppies, so it’s important we
    teach him they’re nothing to worry about.

<h3>You will need</h3>

  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Vacuum cleaner</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    First, start by letting Shadow hear the noise of the vacuum cleaner from
    another room for a couple of minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    If possible, ask a friend to turn on the vacuum cleaner while you are
    playing or sitting with Shadow in another room.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you're alone, leave Shadow with some treats, switch on the vacuum
    cleaner, and return.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ignore the vacuum noise and continue what you were doing before it started.
    This helps Shadow learn that the noise is nothing to worry about.
  </li>
  <li>
    Wait a few minutes before giving Shadow another treat, then switch off the
    vacuum cleaner.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you have a friend, have them use the vacuum cleaner in a nearby room so
    Shadow can see its movement and hear the noise simultaneously.
  </li>
  <li>
    If alone, scatter treats again but avoid using the vacuum cleaner close to
    Shadow just yet. Progress gradually.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Vacuum with Shadow on the other side of a baby gate to avoid frightening
    him.
  </li>
  <li>
    Avoid moving the vacuum cleaner too quickly or directly towards Shadow
    initially.
  </li>
</ul>
