<h1>Sit Part 3</h1>

<p>
  In this lesson, we’ll be starting to teach the word ‘sit’ and putting it
  together with the action so that Shadow can sit when asked. He should now be
  able to sit most of the time without the lure of a treat! But now, it’s time
  to take it to the next level. Don't worry if you're not quite ready to move on
  to this next stage though, as every puppy is different, you can always pop
  back to the library and try an easier lesson.

<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Start by showing Shadow that you have a treat and holding it close to your
    body by your stomach.
  </li>
  <li>Let him remember that to get the treat, he needs to sit.</li>
  <li>
    Now show Shadow you have a treat, as you did before, and get him interested
    in it.
  </li>
  <li>
    When you see Shadow starting to sit, say the cue word (“Sit”) to help him
    link the word to the action.
  </li>
  <li>Drop a treat on the floor the instant Shadow sits.</li>
  <li>Practice this 5 more times.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Let's make this a bit more fun by throwing the treat a little bit away from
    you.
  </li>
  <li>To start, only throw it a very short distance.</li>
  <li>
    Shadow will have to go and get it and probably come straight back to you,
    ready to do it again.
  </li>
</ul>
