<h1>Retrieve Games</h1>
<ol>
  <li>In this lesson, play retrieve games with Shadow.</li>
  <li>
    Shadow should bring a toy back to you when you throw it, most of the time.
  </li>
  <li>You should be able to swap the toy for another toy or a treat.</li>
  <li>
    If Shadow isn't quite there yet, review previous lessons in the library.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Toys</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Stand in the middle of the room with one toy in your hand and the other
    behind your back.
  </li>
  <li>
    Get Shadow interested in the toy you have in your hand and throw it a little
    way across the room so he chases it.
  </li>
  <li>When he brings it back, run away a few steps so he follows you.</li>
  <li>When he gets to you, get him interested in the other toy.</li>
  <li>
    Shadow will drop the first toy, which will be your cue to throw the new one.
  </li>
  <li>When Shadow goes to get it, pick up the first toy.</li>
  <li>
    Repeat as many times as you want. Most German Shepherd Dogs love this game,
    so don't hesitate to make it extra fun!
  </li>
  <li>
    This is a game you can play in the garden as well, so Shadow can get used to
    doing this outdoors.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Never chase Shadow to get the toy back.</li>
  <li>It's no trouble if Shadow doesnâ€™t bring the toy all the way back.</li>
  <li>
    Keep these games gentle and resist the temptation of wanting to throw the
    toys very far.
  </li>
</ul>
