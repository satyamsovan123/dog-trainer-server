<h1>Being alone Part 3</h1>
<p>
  Teaching Shadow that he can’t always follow you is an important step towards
  making them more independent. You’ve already made a great start with this, so
  now it’s time to take it one stage further.
</p>
<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Stuffed chew toy</li>
  <li>Baby Gate</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    As mentioned before, use a baby gate in the doorway so Shadow can see where
    you’ve gone.
  </li>
  <li>
    Give Shadow a treat that will take him a little longer to eat like a toy
    with peanut butter smeared on it, or hidden into it can be really helpful (A
    Kong is a great example).
  </li>
  <li>While he is enjoying the toy, leave the room for 1 minute.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Most German Shepherd Dogs are usually very focused on food and playing with
    toys so Shadow should hardly notice you’ve left, which is exactly what you
    want.
  </li>
  <li>
    If he looks worried, only go as far as the other side of the baby gate for
    the first few times.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don’t stay away for any longer than 1 minute in this first week to avoid
    going too fast.
  </li>
  <li>
    If for any reason you need to leave Shadow for longer, get someone to stay
    with him and keep him company.
  </li>
</ul>
