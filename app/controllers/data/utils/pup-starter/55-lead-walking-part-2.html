<h1>Lead Walking - Part 2</h1>
<p>
  This lesson focuses on teaching Shadow to walk on a loose lead on their
  harness. Brace yourself for much more enjoyable and pull-less walkies! No
  worries if it doesn’t work the first time around - this exercise takes a long
  time to learn and perfect, and you'll be working on this for a while yet, so
  don’t expect too much too soon! Haven’t got Shadow used to the harness yet?
  Pop back to your library and read some of the previous lessons. You’ll get
  them out and about soon enough.

<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Treat pouch</li>
  <li>Harness</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Put the harness on Shadow, just as you have been practising.</li>
  <li>
    Hold a treat in your left hand and have Shadow on your left-hand side.
  </li>
  <li>Show Shadow that you have a treat and hold it at his nose height.</li>
  <li>Walk forward a few steps so he walks beside you.</li>
  <li>After a few steps, say your reward word and give Shadow the treat.</li>
  <li>Do this 5 times.</li>
  <li>
    If Shadow can do this easily, you can show Shadow the treat, hold it in your
    hand near the top of your left thigh, and walk forward normally so Shadow
    walks beside you.
  </li>
  <li>No need to go more than 6 steps - you're already doing great!</li>
  <li>Do this 5 more times.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    With this exercise, you’re teaching Shadow to walk beside you without a
    lead, which will help prevent him from pulling you once on it. It also stops
    any temptation for you to pull him!
  </li>
  <li>
    If Shadow jumps up, hold the treat a little lower and walk a bit faster.
  </li>
  <li>
    If Shadow gets in front of you, use the treat to lure him back to the right
    place and keep walking a few more steps.
  </li>
</ul>
