<h1>Down Part 2</h1>
<p>
  In this lesson, we’ll be focusing on teaching Shadow to lie down without
  having to lure him with a treat - let’s take it to the next level. If Shadow
  isn’t quite there yet, you can pop back to the library to review previous
  lessons. The down can be tricky, so no worries if it takes a bit more
  practise.
</p>
<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Treat pouch</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Practise the “down” as you’ve been doing before, taking the treat to the
    floor and using it to reward, so Shadow can predict what you're doing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once Shadow has done it three times successfully, do exactly the same thing
    without the treat in your hand.
  </li>
  <li>
    The instant Shadow lies down, say your reward word “good”, and then give him
    a treat.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat this at least 6 times. Shadow should lie down when you bring your
    hand to the floor without using a treat to lure them.
  </li>
  <li>
    As Shadow is lying down, add your cue word “down” so that he starts linking
    the word with the action.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Having a treat bag means you can have easy access to the treats without
    holding them in your hand.
  </li>
  <li>
    Go straight from luring Shadow into the down with a treat, to doing it
    without the treat - without stopping. That way, he’s more likely to lie down
    without the treat there to help him.
  </li>
  <li>You should always reward him afterwards, of course 😊</li>
  <li>
    Make sure to say “down” as Shadow is in the middle of lying down, and not
    before. This is because you are teaching him what the word means first.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some puppies can take quite a long time to learn this so don’t worry if
    Shadow doesn’t get this straight away. Take your time and go back to
    practising ‘Down’ by luring with a treat again. With the awesome bond you
    and Shadow have, you’ll ace this in no time!
  </li>
