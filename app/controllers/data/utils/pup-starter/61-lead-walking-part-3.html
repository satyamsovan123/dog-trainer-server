<h1>Lead Walking - Part 3</h1>
<p>
  We'll be prepping Shadow for walks outside in this lesson. Walking on a loose
  lead is important to teach puppies; we know it can be difficult, but persevere
  and everything will be great! Today's goal is to teach Shadow that if the lead
  becomes tight, you will stop! As you may expect, the first few weeks might be
  spent stopping rather than walking. It can take some time for Shadow to become
  used to walking on the lead, so patience will be your friend. If Shadow isn't
  yet comfortable walking on a harness and lead, return to the library and go
  over prior lessons.

<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Treat pouch</li>
  <li>2m Training Lead</li>
  <li>Harness</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Put the harness and lead on Shadow.</li>
  <li>Hold the lead nice and loose and start walking.</li>
  <li>Build up the walking distance with Shadow on a loose lead.</li>
  <li>
    If Shadow gets ahead of you or moves away, so the lead gets tight, just
    stop. No need to pull, stopping will do.
  </li>
  <li>Then, call him back to you by luring him with a treat, if necessary.</li>
  <li>After he comes back, carry on walking.</li>
  <li>
    It's a good thing to reward Shadow every few steps so he learns where you
    want him to walk.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    It will be incredibly helpful if you're enthusiastic when teaching this.
    Basically, you want Shadow to view walking with you as being really fun!
  </li>
  <li>
    As soon as he understands this, he will reduce the pulling and being
    distracted. As you can imagine, this is really important when you go
    outside!
  </li>
  <li>
    If it helps, you can think of the lead as a safety feature rather than a
    tool for pulling, steering, or stopping.
  </li>
</ul>
