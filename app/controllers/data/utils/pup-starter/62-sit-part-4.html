<h1>Sit Part 4 - Outdoors</h1>
<p>
  Let's be honest - dogs don't generalize very well. If you always teach Shadow
  to sit in the kitchen, you may well find he wonâ€™t do it anywhere else. For
  this task, you'll be teaching Shadow that when you say "sit", it also means
  "do it everywhere".
</p>
<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>A little patience!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    In each of the locations, practice all the behaviors you have taught Shadow
    already ("sit", "down", and "recall") about three times each to make sure it
    has stuck.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each time you go to a new location, start the exercise right back at the
    very beginning for the first few times. Luring the first one in each new
    place will really help.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>
  We don't want to burst your bubble, but you can't expect Shadow to do familiar
  exercises everywhere correctly at first, even if he can do it easily where you
  usually train. By teaching him to generalize on all the lessons you do,
  everything will fall into place nicely.
