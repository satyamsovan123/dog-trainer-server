<h1>Lead Walking - Part 1</h1>
<p>
  If Shadow is already comfortable wearing his harness, it's time to start
  teaching him how to walk on a loose lead. Keep in mind that this skill takes
  time for puppies to learn, so don't worry if it's not perfect from the start.
  You'll have plenty of time to practice this over the next few months, making
  your walks together much more enjoyable.

<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Treat pouch</li>
  <li>Harness</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Put the harness on Shadow, as you have been practicing.</li>
  <li>
    Hold a treat in your left hand and position Shadow on your left-hand side.
  </li>
  <li>Show Shadow the treat at his nose-height.</li>
  <li>Walk forward a few steps, encouraging Shadow to walk beside you.</li>
  <li>After a few steps, use your reward word and give Shadow the treat.</li>
  <li>Repeat this exercise around 5 times.</li>
  <li>
    If Shadow performs well, try the exercise again by holding the treat in your
    hand near the top of your left thigh. Then walk forward normally.
  </li>
  <li>
    Limit the distance to around 6 steps for now, celebrating Shadow's progress!
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat the exercise another 5 times and give yourselves a round of applause
    for the effort.
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Youâ€™re teaching Shadow to walk beside you without a lead, preventing him
    from learning to pull.
  </li>
  <li>
    If Shadow jumps up, hold the treat a little lower and walk a bit faster.
  </li>
  <li>
    If Shadow gets in front of you, use the treat to guide him back to the
    correct position.
  </li>
</ul>
