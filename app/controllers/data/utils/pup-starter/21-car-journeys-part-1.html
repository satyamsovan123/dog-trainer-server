<h1>Car Journeys - Part 1</h1>

<p>
  One of the greatest joys of adding a puppy to your family is getting out and
  about and traveling to new places. To do this, you and Shadow will probably be
  spending quite some time in the car. Now is a great time to teach him to enjoy
  going for drives - while he is young and eager to learn new things.
</p>

<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Blankets</li>
  <li>Separation Guard</li>
  <li>Vet Bed</li>
  <li>Some of puppy's food</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>For now, carry Shadow into the back of the car, behind the dog guard.</li>
  <li>
    Get Shadow used to being in the car, behind the dog guard, by feeding him a
    meal in the car (you know how much of a great comforter food is).
  </li>
  <li>
    The first time you do this, don’t go anywhere yet - keep the car stationary.
  </li>
  <li>Repeat this twice more over the next 2 days.</li>
  <li>The two days after that, do the same, but with the engine turned on.</li>
  <li>
    For the rest of the week, if Shadow is happy to be in the car, do the same
    while going on a 5-minute drive.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once you are ready for an actual drive, ask a friend or family member to
    come with you. They can sit in the back to give Shadow a bit of reassurance.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do this training on an empty stomach. We mean Shadow’s - not yours!</li>
  <li>
    Drive on quiet roads first. Avoid Shadow getting scared by fast-moving
    passing traffic.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don’t go for car drives on a warm day, and make sure any air conditioning
    reaches the back of the car.
  </li>
</ul>
