<h1>Continue toilet training</h1>
<p>
  What a great start you've made on your training! From now on, each day (and
  night!) will get easier as you and Shadow get to know each other more, and he
  starts to understand what you want from him. For example, how having a wee on
  your new carpet is not quite acceptable.
</p>
<p>
  If Shadow hasn't got it quite yet, there's no need to worry. Toilet training
  for German Shepherd Dog puppies takes a lot of time and patience from you, and
  also requires for Shadow to not only have to pick up on the lesson, but he to
  develop more bladder and bowel control. Having said this, you can probably see
  how toilet training isn't likely to happen overnight - but you can be sure
  that time, development, and repetition will guide you through it.
</p>
<p>Here's how to keep winning at the toilet training game:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Carry on doing exactly the same as you started yesterday.</li>
  <li>
    Learn Shadow's own tell-tale signals that he needs to go to the toilet (such
    as sniffing or circling) and take him to the toilet as soon as you pick up
    on them. Every puppy is different though, so try to pay extra attention to
    understand your own.
  </li>
  <li>
    During the day, remember to watch him closely so he doesn't get a chance to
    make a mistake, but rather an opportunity to get it right! Remember that
    every success you can reward (and the fewer mistakes you let Shadow make)
    the faster he will be toilet trained.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Tips</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Start by taking Shadow to the bathroom more than you think you need to.
    Trust us, it's better that you have a wasted trip outside or to your toilet
    area than he makes a mistake in the house where you don't want him to go.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remember to reward every single success so that the message stays clear with
    them, and you can move along toilet training faster.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some days, you'll feel like you're just not getting anywhere with Shadow's
    toilet training. Don't worry - you definitely are! Every day is a chance to
    improve. You just need some time, consistency, and repetition.
  </li>
</ul>
