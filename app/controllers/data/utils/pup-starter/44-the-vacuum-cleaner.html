<h1>Introducing Shadow to the Vacuum Cleaner</h1>
<p>
  Vacuum cleaners aren't very popular among many dogs...some will try to play
  with it, while others want to chase it, and some are just really scared of it.
  Our mission is to teach Shadow to ignore them and be happy and comfortable
  around them, too. To get there, the first step is to have him meet it while it
  is turned off.
</p>
<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Vacuum cleaner</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Make sure your vacuum cleaner is in the room you are going to work in with
    Shadow.
  </li>
  <li>Let Shadow come into the room.</li>
  <li>
    As for you, just ignore the vacuum cleaner. If Shadow is curious and feels
    like sniffing or investigating it, let him.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once Shadow has finished inspecting it, get his attention and practise some
    'Watch Me' exercises to give him something else to think about.
  </li>
  <li>Drop the treat on the floor beside you when Shadow looks at you.</li>
  <li>
    Do this in different parts of the room so he gets used to paying attention
    to you around the vacuum cleaner.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can push the vacuum cleaner out of the room after a couple of
    repetitions to let Shadow see that the vacuum cleaner moves.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    You're trying to teach Shadow that he can pay attention to you when the
    vacuum cleaner is there and learn to ignore it.
  </li>
  <li>
    So, you really donâ€™t want him to be playing or climbing around on the vacuum
    cleaner!
  </li>
  <li>We don't want to sound like the fun police, but it's not a toy.</li>
</ul>
