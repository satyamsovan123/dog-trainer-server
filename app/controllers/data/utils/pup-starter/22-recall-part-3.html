<h1>Recall - Part 3</h1>

<p>
  As you are progressing through recall, this lesson focuses on teaching Shadow
  to understand what the cue word for coming towards you really means. If Shadow
  is looking at you blankly when they hear the word, don’t worry! Just go back a
  step and review the previous lesson in the library.
</p>

<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Treat Pouch</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Start in a standing position.</li>
  <li>
    Say Shadow’s name. As he comes towards you, say the cue word you decided on,
    like “come” or “here”.
  </li>
  <li>
    When Shadow gets halfway there, take a few steps backward so he follows you.
  </li>
  <li>When Shadow catches up to you, give him a well-deserved treat.</li>
  <li>
    Repeat this at least 5 more times, each time going backward further and
    faster. Make sure you don't run into anything!
  </li>
  <li>
    You can also reward great recalls with an exciting game using Shadow’s
    favorite toy. Some puppies would rather have playtime than a treat any day!
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Don't worry if Shadow sticks close to you - for this part, he only has to
    take a couple of steps towards you.
  </li>
  <li>
    If Shadow is sticking to your leg like glue, try rolling a treat along the
    floor for him to run after, then practice your recall.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure there isn't anything Shadow can get distracted by. It’s already
    tricky for puppies to concentrate on something, so you want to keep other
    things going on to a minimum.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure to only use the cue word when Shadow is coming towards you. This
    is because you want him to link the word with the action of coming over to
    you, not something else.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don’t touch Shadow or try to get hold of him yet! This exercise is purely
    about coming to you for a yummy reward.
  </li>
</ul>
