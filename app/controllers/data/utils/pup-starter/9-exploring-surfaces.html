<h1>Exploring surfaces</h1>
<p>
  Puppies learn how to interact in the world best by exploring and discovering
  everything around them. For us, this means that by giving them safe and fun
  things to investigate through walking on, climbing over, smelling, or
  listening to, we can help their development process, and build their
  confidence. It's a team job!
</p>
<p>
  Do this little exercise in the room where Shadow feels the most confident and
  spends most of his time during the day.
</p>
<p>
  Try and gather items and objects that Shadow can find appealing and exciting
  to discover. Here are a couple of good examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Paper or plastic bags</li>
  <li>Cardboard boxes</li>
  <li>Cake tins</li>
  <li>Buckets</li>
  <li>An aerobic step</li>
  <li>A fluffy blanket</li>
  <li>A brush</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Then, set up an exploration course, with different objects on the floor for
  Shadow to discover. Let him explore in any way he wants to for however long he
  feels happy to. German Shepherd Dogs love to explore!
</p>
<p>
  This is the perfect time to get creative. Something as simple as a towel
  draped over a cardboard box or a fan blowing over some leaves could be new and
  exciting for Shadow to go under.
</p>
<p>
  You'll also need to be patient for this one. Some pups are really confident
  from the start and can't wait to explore, while others take more time. But
  there's no need to worry if Shadow seems a little wary; puppies who take their
  time, are often the ones who learn the most!

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Add items of different heights for Shadow to stand on like a low box or an
    aerobic step. This will help him to experience life from another
    perspective. How poetic.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hide treats and toys inside, underneath, or on top of some of the objects
    for Shadow to find and be surprised by.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stay close to Shadow. This way, he gets confidence from you being there.
  </li>
  <li>
    Encourage him by using your voice - be sure to keep it joyful and happy!
  </li>
</ul>
