<h1>Stealing items</h1>
<p>
  For a puppy, the world is full of new and exciting things to explore – and as
  Shadow is still only a baby with limited behavioural options, the very best
  way for him to explore is with his mouth. Licking, chewing, carrying around…
  these are all ways Shadow can investigate and interact with the things in his
  new home.
</p>

<p>
  So, it’s therefore important that you remove temptation while Shadow learns
  that everything isn’t a puppy toy. Try to keep the house tidy by removing
  things from the floor or from easy reach – and make sure the whole family does
  the same. And of course, at the same time, ensure Shadow has easy access to
  plenty of his own things to play with or try his teeth on.
</p>

<p>
  Make sure anything that could be dangerous or toxic (or valuable!) is always
  kept out of reach of exploring puppy teeth.
</p>

<p>
  Despite all your best intentions however, there is bound to be a time when
  Shadow gets hold of something that isn’t theirs and that you need to get back
  from him.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Don’t shout or grab at him. He doesn’t know the thing he has is not theirs,
    and it will just frighten him – or make him determined to hold on to it and
    possibly even guard or defend it.
  </li>

  <li>
    Don’t chase him. For a puppy, this can easily turn into a game that they
    think they understand… The ‘if you want it, come and get it’ game that is
    great fun, and that Shadow probably played with his littermates.
  </li>

  <li>
    Also, if you are going to chase him for it, it must be really valuable and
    so worth keeping hold of!
  </li>

  <li>Stay calm!</li>

  <li>
    Find something valuable that you know Shadow loves to swap for the item he
    has stolen. This could be a few tasty treats or a favourite toy – whatever
    Shadow loves the most.
  </li>

  <li>
    Sit on the floor or close to Shadow and entice him with the treat or toy.
    Pay particular attention to it, as if it’s the most valuable and exciting
    thing in the whole world.
  </li>

  <li>
    When Shadow comes to investigate the far more interesting thing you have,
    quietly swap it for the forbidden item and give Shadow plenty of praise.
  </li>

  <li>
    If it is treats you are swapping for, scatter them on the floor so Shadow
    will take some time to eat them, giving you more time to pick up the item.
  </li>

  <li>
    Don’t grab at it – or you could encourage Shadow to try to grab it back!
  </li>

  <li>
    If you have already taught a ‘leave’ cue, you can say that as you take the
    object from him.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Practise swapping toys with Shadow so that he knows that there is always a
  reward for leaving things. Check out the ‘Leave it’ and ‘Drop it’ lessons in
  the app to help guide you on this.
