<h1>Recall Part 5</h1>
<p>
  This lesson will teach Shadow to recall from all different parts of the garden
  so that you can be ready to take it into the "real world". How exciting! If
  your puppy can’t go outside due to vaccinations just yet, you can always
  practise in different areas of the house. Is Shadow’s recall a bit
  hit-and-miss? Pop back to the library a review of previous lessons.

<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Treat pouch</li>
  <li>2m Training Lead</li>
  <li>Harness</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Put the harness and lead on Shadow and go out into the garden.</li>
  <li>
    Let Shadow move away to the end of the lead and wait until he is not
    distracted by a good sniff (this can be tricky - remember he is a German
    Shepherd Dog!).
  </li>
  <li>Say his name and the recall cue word "come”.</li>
  <li>When he comes to you, reward him with a treat.</li>
  <li>
    Move backwards as Shadow is coming towards you - this will make it even more
    fun for him.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat this 5 times in different parts of the garden so it remains in his
    memory.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Start in a spot where there are no distractions. Then, build up to doing it
    everywhere in the garden - no matter what is happening!
  </li>
  <li>
    Take this slowly as he will be very easily distracted by interesting smells.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remember the very first exercise you did with Shadow: "Watch Me". If Shadow
    isn’t looking at you, then you know he isn’t listening.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure you have his attention before asking him to come to you to make
    this as effective as possible.
  </li>
</ul>
