<h1>Sleep training</h1>
<p>
  Where should Shadow sleep? Good question - we have an easy answer: Wherever
  you want him to! However, keep in mind that Shadow is away from his birth
  family for the very first time in his life. So the best place to start with,
  is beside you - his source of love and comfort. This is also a good way to
  start the bonding between you.
