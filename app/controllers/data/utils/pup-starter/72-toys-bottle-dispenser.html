<h2>Toys - Bottle Dispenser</h2>

<p>
  Shadow needs to explore his world and develop his dexterity by chewing,
  mouthing, and pushing objects around. Surprisingly, something as simple as an
  empty plastic bottle will be more than enough to do the trick and fulfill all
  those needs!
</p>

<h3>You will need:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Empty plastic pop bottle</li>
  <li>Nail File</li>
  <li>Sharp knife or scissors</li>
  <li>Puppy's meal</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Remove any plastic rings left from the cap of the bottle, as these can be
    sharp and easily chewed off.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cut several holes around the body of the bottle that are big enough for your
    treats to fall through, making sure there are no sharp areas. This is where
    you'll use a nail file - for nice smooth edges.
  </li>
  <li>Then, fill the bottle with a handful of treats or dry food.</li>
  <li>
    Put the lid on firmly, place it on the floor and encourage Shadow to
    investigate it by rolling the bottle around. Now just sit back, watch, and
    enjoy him having lots of fun!
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Shadow may prefer one type of plastic over another, so experiment to find
    out which he likes best. Some just have the right sort of texture and smell,
    and some don’t!
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure you keep a close eye on Shadow as this isn’t a chew toy. This way
    you can guide Shadow from chewing the lid off or trying to chew into sharper
    areas, and can focus him on getting those treats out instead!
  </li>
</ul>
