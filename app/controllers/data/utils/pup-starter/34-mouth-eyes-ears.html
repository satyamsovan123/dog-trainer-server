<h1>Mouth, Eyes, Ears</h1>
<p>
  While dogs are quite verbal, they can also communicate with us using very
  subtle body language cues. As their family, we want to be able to understand
  them; especially if they are feeling uncomfortable, stressed, or worried.
  Today’s task is about learning how to tell how Shadow is feeling by watching
  his’s face. Almost like a mind-reader.

    Dogs’ faces are very expressive. Their mouth, however, is probably the best
    place to read emotions from.

    Yawning and licking are the two most common indications that Shadow is
    feeling worried (outside of him being sleepy or eating).

    If you see these signs, try, and work out what is making him worried and how
    can you make him feel better.

    Shadow’s eyes will also help you tell whether he is feeling anxious. If he
    is showing white at the sides of his eyes, avoiding looking at something or
    staring unblinking, you can be sure he is feeling worried about something.

    The ears are another way of telling how Shadow is feeling. If he is holding
    his ears back or down, these are clear signals of worry.

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Get into the habit of watching Shadow’s face to check how he is feeling.
    Relaxed eyes, ears, and mouth indicate a happy and content puppy!
  </li>
  <li>
    If everyone in the family learns how to tell what Shadow is feeling, you can
    be sure that he will always be taken care of.
  </li>
  <li>
    Look at photos of dogs on social media and see if you can spot dogs who are
    worried, fearful, or anxious.
