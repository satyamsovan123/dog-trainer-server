<h1>Car Journeys - Part 2</h1>
<p>
  In this lesson, weâ€™ll focus on taking Shadow on longer drives. Perfect for
  when a road trip pops up ðŸ˜Š If Shadow isnâ€™t comfortable going for short
  drives, pop back to the library and review previous lessons. Keep practicing
  until he is ready to move on.

<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Treat pouch</li>
  <li>Water</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Lift Shadow into the back of the car, behind the dog guard.</li>
  <li>
    Go for a short drive (around 15 minutes) to one of the places you will be
    taking Shadow to walk in the future like the park or the vet's office. This
    will help Shadow get used to driving around your area.
  </li>
  <li>
    Take Shadow on slightly busier roads than before so he gets used to seeing
    and hearing a little more traffic.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Rule of thumb: Never leave Shadow alone in the car.</li>
  <li>
    Plan drives between meals. You donâ€™t want Shadow travelling on a full
    stomach and getting your car covered in sick. Sorry for the visual.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure any air conditioning reaches the back of the car. In most cars, it
    doesnâ€™t. Before you go anywhere, sit in the area where Shadow will be
    travelling to see how it feels.
  </li>
  <li>Always travel with water and a bowl and take your treat bag.</li>
  <li>
    Donâ€™t do this task on a warm day. Dogs canâ€™t sweat very well, so they can
    easily overheat in a car.
  </li>
  <li>
    Try to make one of your journeys this week a visit to your veterinary
    practice (by arrangement).
  </li>
  <li>
    To end the trip on a sweet note, ask the receptionist to give Shadow a treat
    before leaving. This will build positive associations with the vet practice
    and make vet visits much easier in the future.
  </li>
  <li>
    If Shadow isnâ€™t fully vaccinated, make sure you carry him in your arms so
    his paws don't touch the floor.
  </li>
</ul>
