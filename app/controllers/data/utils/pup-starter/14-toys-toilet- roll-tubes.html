<h1>Toys - Toilet Roll Tubes</h1>
<p>
  Playing is an important part of a puppy’s development. It can teach them all
  sorts of things; from problem-solving skills to building confidence, to
  learning all about frustration control. Better yet, it’s fun for you both!
  Toys don’t have to be expensive - many of them will end up ripped to shreds
  anyway. You can start by using things you have lying around the house.

<h2>Playing with Toilet Roll Tubes</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Take Shadow out to the toilet first.</li>
  <li>Put some treats into the empty cardboard toilet roll tube.</li>
  <li>Put it on the ground with the ends open.</li>
  <li>
    Encourage Shadow to investigate the tube and find the treats. A cheerful
    voice always helps!
  </li>
  <li>
    Once he knows there are treats in there, you can fold the ends down to make
    the game more challenging.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    If Shadow doesn’t understand the game, let him see you put the treats inside
    the tube, as the point of the game is for Shadow to find the treats inside
    the tube.
  </li>
  <li>Make sure the treats are really tasty. The smellier the better!</li>
  <li>
    When you fold the ends down, do one end first and let Shadow find the treat.
    Then fold both ends.
  </li>
  <li>
    Save lots of tubes in preparation for this game! Some puppies will be gentle
    at getting the treats, while others will tear and rip at the cardboard in
    seconds. Both are fine, just different styles.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't worry, chewing thin cardboard will not hurt Shadow’s mouth or teeth.
    Always supervise this game though, to keep him from eating the cardboard.
