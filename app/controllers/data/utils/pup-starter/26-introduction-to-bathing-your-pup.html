<h1>Introduction to Bathing Your Puppy</h1>

<p>It’s Bathtime!</p>

<p>
  For some puppies, bathtime will be essential for the sheer amount of muddy
  adventures to go on. Long-haired dogs who need regular grooming will also need
  to be bathed more regularly than their short-haired shedding cousins, as with
  non-shedding breeds whose fur holds onto the dirt, and dead coat can become
  trapped. However, all puppies should learn that having a wash is a great time.
  This won’t be hard if you put some time and effort into training this with
  them.
</p>

<p>
  Too often, we just plop them in, put the shower on, and get on with it.
  Unfortunately, this methodology can result in a long-lasting fear of bathtime!
  Let’s do it gradually, and teach Shadow that he doesn’t need to be scared, and
  that bathtime can actually be pretty fun!
</p>

<p>
  Let’s get prepared! To get Shadow started, there are a few things you will
  need to prepare and have with you when you’re ready to get started:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Non Slip mat or old towel</li>
  <li>Brush or comb</li>
  <li>Food Toy or plenty of treats</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Before you start, we recommend you first brush or comb Shadow to get rid of
  any dead coat or tangles. Do pop back to the grooming section in the library
  if he isn’t happy to be groomed yet. Now, you’re ready to move onto the next
  lesson and introduce Shadow to bathtime.
</p>

<h2>Tips:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Take your time with teaching Shadow to be bathed. There’s no need to rush
    it!
  </li>
  <li>
    While you’re still getting him used to the idea, you can always give him a
    wipe over with a warm flannel if he gets a bit grubby until you get Shadow
    to a place where he is happy and ready to get fully wet and soaped.
  </li>
</ul>
