<h1>Keeping teeth off hands</h1>
<p>
  By now, Shadow should be biting you far less as you have hopefully managed to
  teach him to bite a toy rather than you. You also know that he is getting
  enough sleep so he isnâ€™t overtired, grumpy, or overly reactive. There will,
  however, still be times when Shadow will get over-excited when playing, which
  can lead to biting. This task is about finding other ways to reduce this bitey
  excitement!
</p>

<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Licky Mat or Snuffle Mat</li>
  <li>Some of puppy's food</li>
  <li>Patience</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    When you are playing with Shadow, watch out for hints that he is getting
    over-excited as this can easily lead to play biting.
  </li>
  <li>This is entirely natural, of course, but should be discouraged.</li>
  <li>
    When you think that Shadow is getting too excited, try and calm the game
    down a bit to prevent any play biting.
  </li>
  <li>
    Think of ways you can change the game to something that is incompatible with
    biting â€“ such as sniffing and searching.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can do this by either giving Shadow a likkimat smeared with some wet
    food, soft cheese, or yummy puppy paste. You could also try scattering some
    of Shadows food on the floor and hiding treats/food in a snuffle mat for
    Shadow to sniff and search for.
  </li>
  <li>
    This will instantly focus Shadow on sniffing and searching out food â€“ this
    is actually calming for them and will help lower the stimulation that could
    otherwise have led to play biting.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    If Shadow is a bitey puppy or is going through a bitey phase, try and keep
    all games low-key with minimal excitement.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stay away from games where he chases you or is pushed about using your
    hands, since all of these encourage play biting.
  </li>
  <li>
    A good tip is to keep everybody in the family on the same page. Avoid any
    rough or overly exciting games while Shadow is going through this phase so
    he doesn't get confused!
  </li>
  <li>
    Likkimats or snuffle mats can be useful, but all you really need are some
    tasty small food treats that you know Shadow loves.
  </li>
  <li>
    At this stage in Shadowâ€™s training, you should have treats with you all the
    time, as you never know when training opportunities will arise or when you
    want to reward something that Shadow does spontaneously.
  </li>
  <li>
    And donâ€™t worry â€“ this phase will pass, so stay strong and stick with the
    routine and training, and all will be well! ðŸ˜Š
