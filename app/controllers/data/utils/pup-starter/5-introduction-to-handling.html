<h1>Introduction to handling</h1>
<p>
  Remember that Shadow needs time and patience to adjust to his new home and
  family. A calm approach will always be the right way to go - it simply builds
  trust and comfort! Many dogs are worried about being handled, or grow up
  scared of people’s hands, sadly... this is often because they have been
  grabbed or handled roughly, so make sure you start in the right way from the
  very beginning.

<p>Get comfy!</p>

<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>First, sit on the floor.</li>
  <li>
    For now, don’t hold Shadow or make him stay with you. Just let him
    investigate you at his own pace.
  </li>
  <li>
    If he walks off, don’t worry, it doesn’t mean you’re boring. Let him do his
    thing, and wait until he comes back.
  </li>
  <li>
    When he does, let him smell your hands. Once he is confident, you can start
    to stroke him down the sides of his neck and shoulders. Maybe even do a
    gentle bottom scratch!
  </li>
  <li>
    Observe Shadow and work out what places he enjoys being touched. Stay away
    from sensitive bits like the face and paws, for now.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Talk to Shadow in a gentle, quiet voice so he gets used to it.</li>
  <li>
    Spend as long as you want doing this - every minute is building Shadow’s
    confidence anyway.
  </li>
  <li>
    Look out for Shadow starting to get really excited. If this happens, just
    have a quick break, but don’t tell him off or push him away.
  </li>
</ul>
