<h1>Learning Their Name</h1>
<p>
  Teaching Shadow his name is important for all future training. If you can
  teach Shadow to look at you when he hears his name, he will be ready to listen
  to whatever else you might ask him to do!
</p>
<h2>You Will Need</h2>
<p>Soft Treats</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Choose a time when Shadow is awake, but not focussed on something else.
  </li>
  <li>Make sure there are no distractions or other sounds.</li>
  <li>
    Say Shadow’s name brightly and happily, but not too loudly so it scares him
    off.
  </li>
  <li>When Shadow looks at you, throw him a treat.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    If Shadow doesn’t look at you, don’t worry - just wait a few minutes and try
    again.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure you sound happy and enthusiastic! A higher pitched voice than
    usual can help as it's a lot easier to hear for them.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remember to throw the treat immediately, while he is still looking at you.
  </li>
  <li>
    Puppies can only think of one thing at a time, so better not do this when he
    is distracted so you can be the most effective.
  </li>
  <li>
    Only ever use Shadow’s name for good things! You want him to think that
    hearing his name is always worth paying attention to - not run away from.
  </li>
</ul>
