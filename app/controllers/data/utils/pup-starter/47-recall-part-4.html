<h1>Recall Part 4</h1>
<p>
  In this lesson, we‚Äôll be practising recalls in the garden. How exciting! Is
  Shadow able to look at you and come to you when you call his name? If not, pop
  to the library to read the previous lesson, the great outdoors beckons!
</p>
<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Tasty high-value treats</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Find a quiet corner of the garden with as little distraction as you can.
  </li>
  <li>
    Start by going back to the beginning of your recall training by just saying
    Shadow‚Äôs name.
  </li>
  <li>
    Say your reward marker (‚Äúgood‚Äù) and throw him a treat when he looks at you.
  </li>
  <li>
    When Shadow is focused and paying attention to you, drop the treat beside
    you. He should move towards you. As soon as he does, say your recall cue.
  </li>
  <li>Now's the fun part: you can start to make it a game üòä</li>
  <li>
    As Shadow is coming towards you, run away a few steps. He is highly likely
    to follow you! After running a few steps back, stop and reward him with a
    yummy treat when he reaches you.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Patience will do wonders for you here. We recommend spending some time
    reminding Shadow of the very basics you taught them previously. If you need
    a reminder, just head to the library for a refresher.
  </li>
  <li>
    He might be an expert at this exercise in the house, but everything changes
    when a puppy gets outside!
