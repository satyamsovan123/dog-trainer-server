<h1>Toilet Training Introduction</h1>
<p>
  Just to manage your expectations, there is no way of getting toilet training
  right in one go. But precisely because we know how tricky it can be, we've
  done our best at breaking down the training into easy steps with explanations
  to follow. Oh, and remember that Shadow is just a puppy...so don't expect him
  to be fully toilet trained until around 16 weeks old.
</p>
<p>
  The first thing you need to know is that there are two parts to toilet
  training your German Shepherd Dog puppy:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Toilet training during the day (with and without a garden)</li>
  <li>Toilet training during the night</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Both are slightly different, but there is only one key thing that will help
  you succeed - being watchful!
</p>

<h2>Toilet training by day if you have a garden</h2>
<p>Here are some simple steps for you to follow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use baby gates in the doorways of the main room you and Shadow spend most of
    your day in so he stays close to you and don't let him out of your sight!
    You'll need to keep an eye on him all the time. And yes - we do mean all of
    it!
  </li>
  <li>
    While you are establishing Shadow's routine, you'll need to take him out
    every hour for a trip to the loo. Be prepared to wait! German Shepherd Dog
    puppies can easily get distracted, no matter how much they may need to go!
  </li>
  <li>
    Always have at least 6 treats in your pocket and always be ready to reward
    toilet success.
  </li>
  <li>
    Reward Shadow with a treat as soon as he goes to the toilet in his
    designated place.
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep track of the times he needs to go out. These will mostly be when he
    wakes up, after or during a game, after a meal, and after a drink - but keep
    an eye out for other times, maybe Shadow has a special time in the day he
    prefers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Learn Shadow's signs for when he needs to go to the toilet. These can be
    sniffing the floor, turning in circles, trying to find a corner, whining, or
    just being restless. If you see any of the signs, take him outside as
    quickly as possible!
  </li>
  <li>
    Always go with Shadow so you can keep track of whether he has gone to the
    toilet so that you're able to reward him. This is key for showing him he has
    done a good thing!
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Toilet training by day if you don't have a garden</h2>
<p>
  First off - it's important to designate a toilet area for Shadow. This might
  be in several places depending on your home set up. Some examples could be:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your roof terrace</li>
  <li>Your balcony</li>
  <li>Your bathroom</li>
  <li>The corner of your lounge</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Wherever it is, the area needs to be easily cleanable. Think about putting
  down a waterproof membrane if you have carpets/wood or have the toilet area on
  tiled floors. You’ll thank us later! Some people like to use puppy pads or
  newspaper, some people prefer fake grass, and others are happy for their puppy
  to pee onto the concrete and rinse it off. You can also look at building a
  dirt box or putting some turf inside a tray to use as a puppy toilet. It’s a
  good idea to check with the breeder if Shadow has been using a particular
  surface for the toilet – they’ll feel more comfortable going to the toilet at
  yours if they have the same surface to go on. Once you are all set up, you are
  now ready to get Shadow started.

    your day in so he stays close to you and don't let him out of your sight!

<h2>Toilet training by night</h2>
<p>
  When you're toilet training at night, your routine will be quite different
  than in the daytime. Here is how to get on the right track:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Try to go to bed quite late for your first few nights. The later you go, the
    more Shadow will be able to sleep through the night too.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure that the last thing you do before you go to bed is to take Shadow
    to the toilet! Oh, and be prepared to wait as long as it takes for them to
    go. Might be a while! German Shepherd Dog puppies get easily distracted and
    so a lot of toilet training is about patience...on your part, of course.
  </li>
  <li>
    Here comes the fun part...you'll have to set the alarm twice in the middle
    of the night (at around 2.30am and 4.30am) so that he is able to go in the
    right spot when he needs to, and you get to wake up with no accidents beside
    you. Everybody wins!
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure you go with Shadow so you can reward any successes, and so you
    know for sure if he has gone to the toilet or not.
  </li>
  <li>
    If he wakes up at any other time and really won't settle, this probably
    means he needs to go to the toilet again (a puppy won't sleep if they need
    the toilet!).
  </li>
  <li>
    In the morning, aim to get up early (at around 7:00 am), and take him to the
    toilet straight away before you do anything else. Believe us, Shadow is
    highly likely to want to go to the toilet then!
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Remember that the golden secret to successful daytime toilet training for
    German Shepherd Dog puppies is to keep your eyes open, so they won't get a
    chance to make a mistake.
  </li>
  <li>
    The most important piece of advice we can give you is to always reward
    Shadow when they go to the toilet in the right place. Yep, every single
    time. This will let him know you are really happy with what he has done,
    which will make toilet training happen much faster.
  </li>
  <li>
    Never punish mistakes! Big no-no. This will make your toilet training take
    longer, may cause behavior problems, and risks breaking down your
    relationship with Shadow, so it’s best to avoid that. Simply be as watchful
    as you can to prevent accidents.
  </li>
  <li>
    Clean up accidents in places where they shouldn't be, with an enzyme-based
    (not ammonia-based) cleaner to prevent him from wanting to go to the loo
    there again.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Don't worry, as Shadow develops physically, he will be able to hold on for
  longer. Then you can gradually cut out one of the 'middle of the night' toilet
  visits until you are only getting up once. Glory days ahead.
