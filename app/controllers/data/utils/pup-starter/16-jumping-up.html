<h1>Jumping Up</h1>

<p>
  Jumping up is a natural thing for dogs to do. They are just too wholesome and
  have too much love for us! To get our attention and show us how much they
  care, they want to be close to our faces. While this is cute in a puppy, it
  isn’t something we want an adult dog to do, so we’re going to teach Shadow a
  more polite way to greet people. It might take a while for a puppy to learn to
  overcome their natural instincts, but don’t worry, Shadow will get it in no
  time.

<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft treats</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Make a commitment that you are not going to let Shadow jump up to greet you
    anymore. This is harder than it sounds!
  </li>
  <li>
    Remember that what Shadow wants when he jumps up is your attention. He loves
    you and wants to interact with you. Never get cross or impatient with him
    for wanting to show his love.
  </li>
  <li>However, when Shadow does jump up, don’t interact with him.</li>
  <li>
    Gently move away or turn your body so he puts his front paws back on the
    floor.
  </li>
  <li>
    We know this might be tricky because you'd love to give him a cuddle, but
    you want his front paws back on the floor at this stage.
  </li>
  <li>
    The instant Shadow puts his paws back on the floor, give him what he has
    been looking for - your attention!
  </li>
  <li>Give Shadow a treat and tell him how clever he is.</li>
  <li>
    Repeat this every single time you greet Shadow or any time he jumps up.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    At times when you know Shadow is likely to jump up, give him something else
    to do instead, like a 'Sit'.
  </li>
  <li>
    A 'Sit' is perfect because when Shadow is sitting, it means he isn’t jumping
    up. This also gives you a chance to practice the 'sit' and show Shadow what
    you want him to do instead of jumping.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remember that Shadow wants your attention when he jumps up, so never get
    cross or push him away for wanting to show his love.
  </li>
  <li>
    It’s important for everyone in the household to get on board with this. If
    anyone lets Shadow jump up, he will get confused, and will be more likely to
    do it again!
  </li>
  <li>Never punish Shadow for jumping up! Just turn around or move away.</li>
</ul>
