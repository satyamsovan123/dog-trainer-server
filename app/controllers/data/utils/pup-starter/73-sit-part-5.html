<h1>Sit Part 5</h1>

<p>
  In this lesson, we’re going to focus on teaching Shadow to sit when you say
  “Sit” and removing their need to have a treat in view. To do this, Shadow
  needs to understand that a treat at your waist means they have to sit to get
  the treat. If you’re not sure Shadow is ready yet, just pop back to the
  library and have a read of previous lessons. Don’t worry if Shadow ever gets
  confused or doesn’t do something they did perfectly before. Just go back a
  step. Puppies have off-days, just like we do!
</p>

<h3>You will need:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Treat pouch</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Repeat the last step you taught him so he can predict what you're going to
    do.
  </li>
  <li>
    Get Shadow interested in the treat and hold it close to your body. Wait
    until you see Shadow starting to sit. Say the word “sit” and as soon as he
    sits, say your reward word, and drop the treat.
  </li>
  <li>Repeat this 3 times.</li>
  <li>Now, do the same exercise, but without using the treat this time.</li>
  <li>
    When Shadow sits, say your reward word, and give a treat from your bag.
  </li>
  <li>Repeat this 3 times.</li>
  <li>
    When you are sure Shadow will sit, do almost everything the same. Gradually,
    start saying the word “sit” before he starts sitting.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat this 3 times, so that Shadow really starts to grasp this exercise.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Only say “Sit” once. Don’t get into the habit of repeating yourself because
    then Shadow will learn to ignore you until you've said something several
    times!
  </li>
  <li>Make sure he understands each step before moving on to the next one.</li>
  <li>
    It's good for you to know that this lesson involves lots of practice, so
    patience and persistence will be key!
  </li>
  <li>
    Always give Shadow a treat when he gets it right to make the lesson sink in
    as much as possible.
  </li>
  <li>
    Work at Shadow’s own speed. Some puppies get this very quickly, while others
    will take several sessions. Either way, it's all good, as you’ll be having
    fun together!
  </li>
  <li>
    If everything is going well, gradually reduce the body language signals you
    are giving, until Shadow sits on the cue word alone.
  </li>
</ul>
