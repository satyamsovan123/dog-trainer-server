<h1>Down Part 1</h1>
<p>
  You're doing great so far! The ‘Down’ is the next obedience-type exercise you
  will teach Shadow - another exercise that comes under the heading of ‘good
  manners.’ This is a great exercise to teach since we're sure there will be
  many times when you will want Shadow to lie quietly beside you - perfect when
  taking him round to the pub or out to a café.
</p>
<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Start this exercise from a ‘Sit’ position as Shadow is already halfway to
    lying down.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hold a treat in your hand by Shadow’s nose and get him interested in it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bring your hand slowly down to the ground, slightly between his front paws.
    Shadow’s nose will follow your hand down.
  </li>
  <li>Hold the treat on the floor while he tries to get at it.</li>
  <li>
    Be patient! It might take some time to get a response as well as a bit of
    trial and error for where to put the treat.
  </li>
  <li>
    Eventually, Shadow will lie down to try and get at the treat because it’s
    just more comfortable for him.
  </li>
  <li>The instant he lies down, say your reward word (“Good”). Great job!</li>
  <li>Give Shadow the treat immediately and repeat 5 times.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Try covering the treat slightly with your hand. You might get nibbled and
    scratched a bit, but it does make it much easier!
  </li>
  <li>
    If Shadow seems to lose focus, that’s totally fine and very normal! Just let
    him wander off. You can always get him back with the treat and try again
    later.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remember to be patient! This is a new skill for you both, so it’s no problem
    at all if it takes a little while to learn.
  </li>
</ul>
