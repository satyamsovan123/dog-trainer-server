<h1>Play Biting</h1>
<p>
  Puppies use their teeth to play with their littermates, but it's important to
  teach Shadow that when playing with humans, biting is not really a thing.
  Today, you will learn how to teach Shadow exactly this - how not to use his
  teeth when he gets excited playing with you. Painless play times ahead!

  <li>
    <p>
      If Shadow starts to get too excited and bitey, first try to direct him
      onto a toy to bite instead. Make sure that you are using a toy that Shadow
      really likes, and that is long enough that your hands aren't too close to
      those super sharp teeth.

      If Shadow is still biting, try wiggling the toy along the floor,
      alternating between fast and slow movements. This helps make the toy
      really interesting for Shadow and helps him to stop biting you a bit more
      easily.

      You can also distract him from biting you by giving him something more
      rewarding to do instead. For example, you might want to practise some
      'sits', and giving Shadow a reward each time.

      If he is still quite passionate about biting, get up and walk away for a
      couple of minutes. By doing this, you are teaching Shadow that if he wants
      fun games and interactions to continue, then using teeth can't come into
      the picture.

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Donâ€™t push Shadow away or shout when he uses teeth. This might actually
      work against you - as it's likely to escalate Shadow's excitement and
      increase his biting.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Always have a toy handy to direct him towards, instead of your hands.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A good thing to note is that puppies often bite when they are over-tired.
      Never forget how much sleeping time Shadow needs!
