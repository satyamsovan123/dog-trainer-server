<h1>Sit Part 1</h1>
<p>
  ‘Sit’ is the first obedience-type exercise that Shadow will learn. ‘Sit’ is
  the start of teaching him good manners, since it's such good greeting
  behaviour. If Shadow can 'sit' to greet someone, then he isn't jumping up
  which means no one is getting dirty paw marks, and you’re not getting funny
  looks. This lesson won't actually use the word 'Sit' yet, as that comes a
  little later!

<p>Soft Treats</p>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Choose a time to train when Shadow is hungry; before a meal is a good
      idea. Also make sure that there are no distractions around to interfere
      (German Shepherd Dog puppies are often easily distracted!).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Show Shadow you have a yummy treat in your hand and get him interested in
      it.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Hold the treat by Shadow’s nose, and then lift your hand slowly up, and
      back towards his tail slightly.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      As his nose comes up, his bottom will go down. This probably won’t happen
      on the first go, so just keep trying. Yes, you may need a little extra
      patience!
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When Shadow sits, say your marker word (“Good”), and give him the treat
      immediately.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Although you might be tempted, don’t push Shadow’s bottom down. This will
      make him feel wary about your hands and begin to worry about being
      touched.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Repeat this until Shadow puts his bottom on the floor as soon as you move
      the treat up. There you have it!
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      If Shadow doesn’t immediately get the hang of this, don’t worry. That's
      perfectly normal; some puppies need several goes at this to start with.
      Especially German Shepherd Dogs!
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If Shadow seems to lose his focus, let him wander off and try again in a
      few minutes. German Shepherd Dog puppies don’t tend to have an incredible
      attention span anyway.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Be patient! This is a new skill for you both that will soon be achieved.
      It just needs some time and patience.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Remember to say your marker word ("Good") the instant Shadow sits, and
      give the treat straight away as they do it. It will speed up the learning
      process quite significantly.

</ul>
