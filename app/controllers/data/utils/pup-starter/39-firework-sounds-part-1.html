<h1>Firework Sounds Part 1</h1>
<p>
  Teaching Shadow to get used to loud and potentially scary sounds is very
  important. This lesson focuses on getting Shadow used to Firework sounds. We
  ideally want to build these sound habituation lessons up slowly to give Shadow
  the best chance of success. If he hasn't got used to quiet storm sounds with
  you yet, it's worth popping back over that in the library where you’ll find
  all of the sound habituation lessons.

<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Clips or sounds of fireworks</li>
  <li>Puppy's meal</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Get the fireworks sound effect ready to start at a low volume.</li>
  <li>Remember that Shadow’s hearing is better than yours!</li>
  <li>
    Start with the sound at a very low volume, ensuring it doesn’t elicit any
    reaction from Shadow initially.
  </li>
  <li>Place down Shadow’s food.</li>
  <li>Play the sound effect very quietly while Shadow is eating.</li>
  <li>
    Allow the sound to continue for 5 minutes after Shadow finishes eating.
  </li>
  <li>Repeat this exercise daily at various times.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If Shadow reacts to the sound, it's too loud; decrease the volume.</li>
  <li>
    Refrain from displaying any reaction yourself to help Shadow feel safe.
  </li>
  <li>
    If Shadow seems worried, revert to starting from the beginning to ease any
    discomfort.
  </li>
</ul>
