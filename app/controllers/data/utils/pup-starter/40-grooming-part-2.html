<h1>Grooming Part 2</h1>
<p>
  In this lesson, we’ll be teaching Shadow to allow us to groom sensitive areas
  such as their paws and tummy. Are they happy being groomed? If not, pop back
  to the library and review a previous lesson on grooming and keep practicing
  until he is ready to move on.
</p>
<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Soft brush</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Do this at a time when you are both relaxing together. When you're both
    feeling happy, start brushing Shadow as you have been doing before.
  </li>
  <li>
    As you are brushing, run your hands down Shadow’s paws and over his stomach.
  </li>
  <li>
    Then, slowly let the brush follow your hands. This will help Shadow get used
    to being brushed all over.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be aware that many dogs have very sensitive legs and paws, so it's important
    to be gentle.
  </li>
  <li>
    Give Shadow a treat after every 3 brush strokes on his legs or stomach. He
    is doing great!
  </li>
  <li>
    Use a soft, clean cloth to wipe Shadow’s face, including his eyes. Nobody
    likes eye bogies!
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    The best time to do this is while Shadow is relaxed beside you so that it
    doesn’t turn into a game.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don’t hold on to his paws to brush them, since it can make him feel trapped.
  </li>
  <li>
    If he starts getting a little fidgety, it's better to leave it for another
    time. This is gentle grooming, not a wrestling match!
  </li>
  <li>
    Continue to use treats. Make sure that Shadow always thinks that grooming is
    a positive experience.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can also use the treats to distract Shadow if he thinks that playing
    with the brush is a better game!
  </li>
</ul>
