<h1>Playing together</h1>
<p>
  German Shepherd Dogs love to play. Playing is also one of the best bonding
  exercises you can do with each other! In this lesson, you’ll be learning to
  play ‘dog games’ for a great start to your journey and relationship with
  Shadow.
</p>
<p>
  Start by sitting on the floor with Shadow and have the toys behind your back.
  Then, bring one out and wiggle it around to intrigue Shadow. Let Shadow chase
  it gently for a few seconds, and then let him get hold of it.
</p>
<p>
  Have a very gentle and very short tug game. This game will be great for
  helping Shadow get the confidence to tug. This means that you'll mostly be
  just holding it and wiggling it a bit. Remember to keep it gentle – no rough
  tuggy at this stage!
</p>
<p>
  After a short time, stop tugging and bring out the other toy. Wiggle it to
  ‘bring it to life’. Shadow will probably let go of the first toy and focus on
  the more interesting one.
</p>
<p>
  Continue to play with Shadow with this new toy. Then repeat this game a few
  times, swapping between the toys.
</p>
<p>
  When you finish, swap both toys for a treat. Besides this being a fun game,
  you are also starting to teach Shadow ‘Leave’ - or leave things alone. If
  Shadow starts getting too energetic, it's better to stop the game and come
  back to it when he is less excited.
</p>
<p>
  Start to build a list of which toys Shadow likes, and see if you can work out
  Shadow’s playing style. Does he prefer to use his mouth? Or his paws? Play
  this game with Shadow as part of your playtime for the rest of the week. It’s
  lots of fun and will also start to build a really nice bond between you both.
