<h1>Teaching Independence to Shadow</h1>

<p>
  Teaching Shadow that he can’t always follow you around is an important first
  step towards him being independent and feeling okay when left alone. To make
  the transition smoother, you'll have to start practicing this from the very
  beginning of your life together. Bear in mind that teaching will require time,
  and lots of patience as being left alone is not the most natural for any dog,
  including German Shepherd Dogs (or humans, for that matter!). Shadow loves to
  be around you - you are his family and he feels safe with you.

<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Baby Gate</li>
  <li>Puppy's meal</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Give Shadow his meal at the usual time.</li>
  <li>
    While he is eating, start by quietly leaving the room for 1 minute only.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use a baby gate on the doorway to wherever you feed Shadow. This way he can
    see where you’ve gone and not worry about it.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Most German Shepherd Dogs are so focused on their food, they will hardly
    even notice you’ve gone. This is a good thing!
  </li>
  <li>
    If Shadow looks at all worried, only go as far as the other side of the baby
    gate for the first few times.
  </li>
  <li>
    No need to stay away too long - just 1 minute in this first week will do!
  </li>
</ul>
