<h1>Tails</h1>
<p>
  Dogs communicate with us using body language cues. If we want to be able to
  understand them and know if they are feeling uncomfortable, stressed, or
  worried, we need to know how to read those cues. Today’s task is all about
  tails – and how they might not be saying what you think! Read our body
  language article before doing this lesson; you'll find it in the library.

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Most people think that when a dog wags their tail, they are always happy and
    friendly...but this isn’t always the case.
  </li>
  <li>
    A relaxed tail wag held level with the body is almost always positive; so is
    a higher excited tail wag if you're having a game or doing something fun.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a tail is held stiffly and the wag looks tense, often this indicates that
    a dog isn’t comfortable in the situation. At this point, they might also be
    considering if they need to take some action.

  <li>
    Equally, a low tentatively wagging tail, held down or even between the legs,
    can be showing worry or fear.

    For this week, watch Shadow’s tail and learn how he wags when he is playing,
    happy, excited, and relaxed. Try to see if you can tell what his tail is
    telling you each time.

<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Practise watching other dogs while you're watching Shadow – and you will
    soon begin to see very clearly how tails can say very different things.
  </li>
  <li>
    Being aware that dogs are communicating all the time with body language cues
    is really the secret to understanding Shadow.
