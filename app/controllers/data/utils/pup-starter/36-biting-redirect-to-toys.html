<h1>Biting - Redirect to Toys</h1>
<p>
  All puppies bite when they start to play with us, and we can't blame them!
  This is something they have been doing regularly with their littermates. But
  it's important to know how to teach them that when playing with people, teeth
  shouldn't be involved. Those sharp teeth do make quite an impression. Don't
  worry, there's an easy way to show him this though - it's as simple as
  encouraging him to bite a toy instead of your hands.
</p>
<p>What you'll need for this is toys. ...Lots of toysðŸ¤£</p>
<p>
  Don't underestimate the number of toys you will go through during this phase!
</p>
<p>
  Rubber chew toys or robust soft puppy toys are ideal for this - they will
  massage Shadow's gums in all the right places, which will make him feel better
  and help with those teething pains too.
</p>
<h2>Here's how to do it</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Any time you are playing or having a bonding moment with Shadow, have a
      toy you know he enjoys playing with nearby.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If he starts to bite your hands or your clothing, use the toy to deflect
      his biting onto that instead, so he is playing with the toy and not your
      body parts!
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Keep playing the game for a few minutes while you let him chew the toy.
      Here, Shadow will be learning that he can still have lots of fun with you
      in ways that don't include his teeth sinking into your skin. Ouch!
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When you're playing, brushing, stroking, or interacting with Shadow, keep
      a toy within reach to guide him in the appropriate way. Make sure everyone
      else in the family does the same thing to ensure that the lesson sticks
      with Shadow as much as possible. It will help to reinforce your teaching
      and ensure consistency.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Your best friend during this phase will be 'consistency' and 'practice',
      especially around nipping and biting, but don't worry as Shadow will soon
      learn how to play gently, and playtimes will get a lot less painful for
      you both!
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      You'll probably want to spend some time discovering what kind of toys
      Shadow enjoys playing with and chewing. Some prefer softer toys, while
      others like gnawing rubber toys or tugging on rope type toys. However,
      always ensure that whichever toy you pick is safe - not too big, not too
      small, and not too hard!
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Although squeaky toys sound like a good idea, they might backfire at this
      point. The sound can be a little too exciting for Shadow for the time
      being while he is still learning and can sometimes increase biting.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If Shadow is struggling to stop biting you and start playing with the toy,
      try wiggling it around the floor next to him to help encourage Shadow to
      chase the toy a little before letting them catch it and chew on it while
      you're holding it. This helps make the toy super interesting and makes it
      easier for them to let go of you!
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Remember to never punish Shadow for play biting! This can make things a
      little iffy between you - and you definitely want to keep it as positive
      and fun as possible!
