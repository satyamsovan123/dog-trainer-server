<h1>The Outside World</h1>

<p>
  Although Shadow is still in his early weeks, this is a good time to start
  teaching him everything about the outside world to ease him into it. Things
  that are met safely now are far more likely to be accepted without fear or
  worry in the future.

  <li>Treat pouch</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Carry Shadow to the end of your garden or driveway and let him see what’s
    going on in the road outside.
  </li>
  <li>
    Let him watch, hear, and smell whatever is going on from a safe distance:
    people, other dogs, traffic, birds, and so on for about 10 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Give Shadow the occasional treat, especially after anything new has gone
    past, to make the experience even better for him.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This lesson is about watching and experiencing from a distance.</li>
  <li>
    Remember, Shadow isn’t fully vaccinated just yet, so do not put him on the
    ground when outdoors, nor let him interact with other dogs or people. The
    day will soon come when you get to do that!
  </li>
  <li>
    If Shadow seems worried by anything, move further away. DO NOT take him any
    closer to ‘see that it’s safe’, because it simply doesn't work - all it does
    is set up fears in the future.
  </li>
</ul>
