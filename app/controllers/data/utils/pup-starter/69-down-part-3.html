<h2>Down Part 3</h2>
<p>
  In this lesson, we’ll start removing the hand signal and begin to teach Shadow
  the verbal cue. Hopefully Shadow has learned to lie down when you bring your
  hand to the floor, so he is beginning to link what they’re doing to the
  action. If not, pop back to the library and have a read of the previous
  lessons. You are now both ready to move on to the next stage! If Shadow isn't
  quite ready yet, just keep practicing the previous lessons until he is ready -
  it’s a marathon, not a sprint!

<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Practice the ‘Down’ a few times as you’ve been doing before. You already
    know the drill: bring your hand down and wait for them to lie down.
  </li>
  <li>Go over it a couple of times until Shadow does this easily.</li>
  <li>
    Now, let's change this up a bit. This time, don’t bring your hand all the
    way to the floor, but just say “down” as Shadow lies down. From now on, this
    is what you'll always do.
  </li>
  <li>
    The instant Shadow lies down, say your reward word (“good”), and give him a
    well-deserved treat.
  </li>
  <li>Repeat this 6 times.</li>
  <li>
    Next, take a treat out of your bag, and just wait. You want Shadow to
    remember what worked to get a treat. If he lies down straight away, give him
    a bigger treat as an extra special reward.
  </li>
  <li>
    We’re not going to lie; this is a tricky exercise. You may have to gradually
    reduce your hand signal rather than do it all at once, which is absolutely
    fine. Every puppy is different, so let's stick to what works best for
    Shadow.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Patience is key! Don't be afraid to take as much time over this as he needs.
    It's already a big step!
  </li>
  <li>
    If Shadow wanders off, change position, and get him interested in the treat
    again.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each time you practise 'Down', start by luring with treats at first. Some
    dogs take quite a long time to learn this, so don’t worry if it takes a
    couple of weeks.
  </li>
</ul>
