<h1>Being Alone Part 2</h1>
<p>
  Teaching Shadow to learn how to be alone and happy is very important because
  we can’t possibly be with them all of the time - much as they might like us to
  be! This lesson takes you through how to teach Shadow to be alone for up to 5
  mins. Being ‘happy home alone’ can take a while for some dogs to learn, so
  taking it slowly and in line with how ready your pup is will be super
  important in building up their confidence. If Shadow is at all worried about
  being left - don’t worry, you can go back a step and have a read of an easier
  lesson in the library.

<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Baby Gate</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>Today's task is to leave Shadow alone for a little longer.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Scatter treats around the floor where Shadow will be left by himself.</li>
  <li>
    Leave the room, close the baby gate or door, and go out of sight. Make sure
    not to go too far!
  </li>
  <li>Start with 2 minutes and repeat this every day.</li>
  <li>
    If Shadow isn’t worried by your absence, you can build it up to 5 minutes
    this week.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can also leave Shadow for a few minutes while they enjoy a good nap in
    their crate.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    If Shadow is at all worried about being left, don't move onto this step yet
    - you’ve got plenty of time, and it’s far better to go slowly as he is of a
    breed that is highly bonded to their owner and can often find being left
    alone very difficult.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don’t be tempted to stay away for any longer than 5 minutes by the end of
    this week.
  </li>
  <li>
    If for any reason you need to leave Shadow for longer, get someone to stay
    with them.
  </li>
</ul>
