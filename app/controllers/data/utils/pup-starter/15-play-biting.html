<h1>Play Biting</h1>

<p>
  It's very likely that Shadow will start nipping and biting you soon after they
  arrive home, however, don't worry! This is totally normal behaviour, and over
  the next few weeks, you will be learning how to deal with this in a way that
  improves your relationship and keeps Shadow's teeth away from your skin!
</p>

<p>
  In the first weeks of a puppy's life, they start to develop early play and
  social behaviours - and these games naturally involve mouthing and biting
  their mum and littermates - as at that age, they have no other way to play.
</p>

<p>
  The definition of 'socialisation' means that the puppy learns who their social
  group is and to who they show these play responses. Now that Shadow has come
  home, his social group is transferring from his littermates to you and your
  family. Shadow will want to interact and play with you - and right now, the
  only way he knows how to do that is with his teeth!
</p>

<p>
  This isn't being aggressive or wanting to cause you pain. In fact, totally the
  opposite. Shadow wants to play with you, looks at you as part of his family,
  and wants to bond with you. Play is the start of building a relationship. The
  problem is; biting hurts, and it isn't appropriate in an adult dog.
</p>

<p>
  For owners who are unprepared for puppy play biting and don't understand why
  it happens, this can be a bit of a shock. With a bit of understanding and good
  management, however, you can easily discourage Shadow from play-biting and
  give him better ways of interacting with you without damaging your budding
  relationship. Poorly managed, it can encourage biting and break down the bond
  between you.
</p>

<p>
  The most important rule is never to punish Shadow for play biting. It can
  sometimes be tempting - especially as an instinctive reaction if he has hurt
  you - but look at this from Shadow's point of view. He is starting to get to
  know you and wants to play with you. However, if when Shadow tries, in the
  only way he knows how, he gets punished, this can break down any early trust
  Shadow has in you - something that can cause issues in the future.
</p>

<p>
  Not only that, but aggression breeds aggression, and often puppies who have
  been inappropriately punished for play biting frequently go on to bite for
  real.
</p>

<p>
  The secret is not just to discourage the biting but instead replace that need
  to interact with something far more appropriate to life as a companion dog.
</p>

<h2>Dealing with play biting</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    First make sure Shadow is getting enough sleep. Young puppies need at least
    18 hours of sleep a day, and a tired, overstimulated puppy is very often a
    bitey puppy. Give plenty of time for naps and quiet time. If you have a
    'busy puppy', having a crate set up in the family room where they can sleep
    can be really helpful.
  </li>
  <li>
    While Shadow is learning how to interact with the family, keep games and
    play low-key and gentle. Biting comes from the desire to play so when play
    gets rough or highly arousing, the instinct to bite as part of that play is
    heightened and intensified.
  </li>
  <li>
    Have lots of good chew toys available for Shadow - rubber ones are ideal as
    they are soft but still robust. If he starts play biting, deflect him onto a
    toy. Keep hold of the toy so you are still playing and interacting but
    slowly, Shadow will be learning that he can have great games with you but
    biting toys, not skin.
  </li>
  <li>
    Although you are holding the toy, still keep the interaction gentle and
    low-key. Any time Shadow starts to play bite, your focus should be to
    deflect but also to lower his excitement and arousal (high arousal =
    heightened instinct to play bite).
  </li>
  <li>
    If you can't lower Shadow's arousal, you can try behaving like his
    littermates would have done if they had been bitten too hard. That is to say
    'ow' as if you had been hurt, and stop interacting with them for a minute
    (no more). This can be extremely effective with some puppies as it teaches
    them that if they want the game to continue, they shouldn't use teeth, but
    in others, it actually heightens their arousal, so this is very much a case
    of knowing your own puppy.
  </li>
  <li>
    If this doesn't work, try to spot the symptoms of rising arousal and change
    the game to something incompatible with biting - such as scattering treats
    or using a licky mat. When his nose is on the ground, he is still having
    fun, but his teeth are not on you!
  </li>
