<h1>Storm Sounds</h1>

<p>
  Life is full of unexpected noises: thunder, fireworks, screaming children, and
  many more. For a puppy, these might not be the most pleasing sounds to hear,
  and some puppies can actually find them to be quite terrifying. However, these
  early developmental weeks are the perfect time for puppies to learn to accept
  these 'novel' sounds as normal. With a little bit of work during this critical
  development period, Shadow will take these noises in his stride.

<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Clips or sounds of storm noises</li>
  <li>Puppy's meal</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Start by playing the sound at low volume. Remember that Shadow’s hearing is
    better than yours! At this point, you want it so quiet that he doesn’t react
    at all.
  </li>
  <li>Put down Shadow’s food.</li>
  <li>Play the sound effect very quietly while he is eating.</li>
  <li>
    Let it continue playing for 5 minutes after Shadow has finished his meal.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If Shadow reacts at all, this means the sound is too loud.</li>
  <li>
    Don’t react to the sounds yourself! You are Shadows reference to everything,
    so if you look surprised or stressed, Shadow will be as well.
  </li>
  <li>
    If Shadow ever looks worried, go back a few steps and lower the volume!
  </li>
</ul>
