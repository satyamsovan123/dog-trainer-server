<h1>Recall - Part 1</h1>
<p>
  Recall is definitely one of the most important things you will teach Shadow.
  Teaching him to come back when you call means you can let him off the lead in
  secure places. You will also feel a lot better on walks as Shadow can get the
  exercise he needs, and you know that you can always call him away from
  trouble.
</p>
<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Treat pouch</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Choose a time when Shadow is awake, but not focused on something else.
  </li>
  <li>Make sure there are no distractions or other sounds.</li>
  <li>
    Say Shadow’s name brightly and happily, but not too loudly, so it scares him
    off.
  </li>
  <li>
    This time, when he looks at you, drop the treat on the ground near you.
    Shadow has to come to you to get the treat.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Make sure there are no distractions. Remember that German Shepherd Dog
    puppies can only think about one thing at a time!
  </li>
  <li>
    Try not to touch Shadow or try to get hold of him. This task is purely about
    coming to you when he hears their name, so it's better to keep practicing
    without any hands.
  </li>
  <li>
    If he doesn’t come to you, try again later after a break. Try the lesson
    when you know Shadow is hungry so they're more alert!
  </li>
</ul>
