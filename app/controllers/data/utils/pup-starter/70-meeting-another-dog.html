<h1>Meeting Another Dog Outdoors</h1>
<p>
  Of course, we want Shadow to be friendly with people and other dog friends.
  You have nothing to worry about for now - German Shepherd Dogs are very social
  dogs and are quite fond of playing with others.
</p>

<h3>You will need:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Toys</li>
  <li>2m Training Lead</li>
  <li>Harness</li>
  <li>Another dog friend</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Ask your friend to bring their dog into the garden.</li>
  <li>The dog must be on a lead and should be fully vaccinated.</li>
  <li>
    Then, bring Shadow out into the garden, and sit quietly together with your
    friend and their dog.
  </li>
  <li>
    Let Shadow lead the interaction. At this point, you won’t know how he may
    react. He might start off a little worried or be wildly excited at the
    thought of a new friend. Either is fine!
  </li>
  <li>
    It's better if we lay off a little here and not encourage Shadow to interact
    with the older dog in any way, so that he gets to make the choice for
    himself.
  </li>
  <li>
    Giving both dogs treats at the same time is a good idea - try to do this
    about 5 times during the visit.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    We know it might be really tempting, but let's not go on to play off-lead
    games for now. That will come later!
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure Shadow is the one to choose how to approach and interact with new
    friends. This will help him feel more confident and in control.
  </li>
  <li>
    Keeping Shadow's attention around other dogs will certainly be a challenge!
    But nothing you can't manage.
  </li>
  <li>You’ll have time to work more on this in the coming weeks.</li>
</ul>
