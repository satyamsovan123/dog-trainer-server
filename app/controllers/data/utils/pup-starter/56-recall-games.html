<h1>Recall Games</h1>
<p>
  Games are one of the best activities to help with Shadow’s training. They’re
  fun for you, as well as for him! This one in particular will help with his
  recall and sharpening his focus on you. If Shadow’s recall needs some work,
  you can also review previous lessons in the library.
</p>
<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Treat pouch</li>
  <li>Someone familiar to your puppy to help</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Go into a room in your house, one that won't distract Shadow.</li>
  <li>Kneel down at opposite ends of the room.</li>
  <li>
    Call Shadow’s name and when he looks over at you, drop a treat on the floor.
  </li>
  <li>
    You'll see Shadow trot over to get the treat. After Shadow has eaten the
    treat, have your helper do the same.
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep going, calling his name one at a time until he is going back and forth
    between the two of you.
  </li>
  <li>
    As he is coming towards you, add the cue word (“come”) to start letting that
    sink in.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Start quite close together for an easy start. You can move further apart as
    Shadow begins to understand what you want him to do.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the other person is calling Shadow, it's better if you don’t hold any
    food in your hand - this is where a treat bag comes in handy.
  </li>
</ul>
