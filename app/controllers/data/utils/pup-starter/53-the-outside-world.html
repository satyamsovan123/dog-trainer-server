<h1>The outside world</h1>
<p>
  It's now time to show Shadow a little more of the outside world so that he can
  experience all the sounds, smells and sights that he will need to get used to.
  Remember to take this at Shadow's own pace - if he is less confident, take
  this slowly.
</p>
<h2>Let's begin!</h2>
<p>
  Choose a time of day when it is relatively busy outside and have at least 20
  treats in your pocket. Carry Shadow to the end of your garden or driveway and
  let him watch whatever is going on from a safe distance, e.g. people, other
  dogs, traffic.
</p>
<p>
  With Shadow in your arms, go for a short walk with him so he can experience
  all these new sights, sounds and scents. Feel free to enjoy your walk for as
  long as Shadow is happy or your arms can manage it!
</p>
<p>
  Give him the occasional treat, about one every 30 seconds. This will make the
  experience even more positive!
</p>
<p>
  Stop and talk to people whenever you can - it will be a great learning
  experience for him.
</p>
<p>
  Ask people not to touch Shadow yet. Because you are holding him, he can't move
  away if he feels uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
  Remember Shadow might not be fully vaccinated, so don't put him on the ground
  just yet if that’s the case. If Shadow seems at all worried by anything, move
  further away. Don’t take him any closer to 'see that it's safe' because this
  could set up fears in the future - and we don't want those!
</p>
