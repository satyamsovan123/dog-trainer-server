<h1>Biting and Sleep</h1>
<p>
  You now know why puppies bite and how to deflect biting onto toys, but there
  are other things to be aware of that can also increase play biting and make it
  worse.
</p>

<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Stuffed chew toy</li>
  <li>Crate or Playpen</li>
  <li>Licky Mat</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Puppies need a lot of sleep – and at this age, Shadow should be sleeping for
    around 18 hours a day.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make a timetable of Shadow's regular daily routine and see if he is getting
    enough sleep. Many ‘bitey’ puppies are actually over-tired. This often
    happens when the whole family is at home, as there is always something going
    on, and that can prevent Shadow from getting enough good quality sleep.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you discover that Shadow isn’t getting the sleep he needs, make sure you
    schedule that into his day.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can use the crate or playpen, so they can sleep close to you whatever
    you are doing – but not be tempted to join in.
  </li>
  <li>
    Give them a stuffed chew toy or lickimat to help settle them down into that
    much-needed nap.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Have a game or a training session first, so you know that Shadow is tired
    and more likely to sleep.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure Shadow has been to the toilet, so they are likely to settle and
    sleep.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remember that puppies sleep in lots of short naps during the day. Make sure
    all the family know that when Shadow is sleeping, he isn’t to be disturbed.
  </li>
</ul>
