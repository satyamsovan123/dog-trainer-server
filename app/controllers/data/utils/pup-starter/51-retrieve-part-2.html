<h1>Retrieve Part 2</h1>
<p>
  Fun times ahead, let's teach Shadow to retrieve. In this task, we will work on
  encouraging Shadow to bring and give the toy back to you. German Shepherd Dogs
  are quite fond of these kinds of games, so they usually pick them up quite
  quickly, and it gives you a fun way to play together in return.

<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Toys</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Roll or gently throw Shadow’s toy a little bit away from him.</li>
  <li>
    This time, when he picks it up, move a few steps backwards to encourage him
    to follow you with the toy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stop after a few steps and when he gets to you, take hold of the toy but
    don’t tug or pull.
  </li>
  <li>
    Instead, show him the other toy and wriggle it around to get him more
    interested in that one.
  </li>
  <li>
    When Shadow lets go of the first toy, throw the second one. It's all about
    swapping!
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat this 5 times and make sure to incorporate this into your playtimes
    from now on to help with practice.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Don’t worry if Shadow doesn’t bring the toy all the way back. It's better if
    you don’t go forward towards him or try to grab it! Just show him the second
    toy and keep rewarding every attempt.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some puppies take longer to learn that giving you something back means the
    game continues!
  </li>
  <li>
    If Shadow still won’t let you take hold of the toy, make the second toy much
    more interesting by making it come alive with funny voices or dragging it on
    the floor. When he then lets go of the first toy, throw the second one.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be upbeat and enthusiastic when you are playing with Shadow! It will really
    help to keep him engaged and interested.
  </li>
</ul>
