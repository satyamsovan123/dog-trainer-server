<h1>Teaching Shadow to Settle</h1>
<p>
  There will be lots of times you just want Shadow to settle calmly beside you.
  He does a great job at keeping anyone company, after all! This could be while
  you are watching TV, working from home, visiting friends, or going to a café.
  For good times out and about, this is a very important life skill for Shadow
  to learn.
</p>
<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Stuffed chew toy</li>
  <li>2m Training Lead</li>
  <li>Harness</li>
  <li>Vet bed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Have a piece of vetbed, or something comfortable for Shadow to lie on,
    beside your favourite chair, and put on Shadow’s harness or collar before
    you start.
  </li>
  <li>
    Attach the lead to the harness, and the lead to the leg of the chair. Then,
    sit down to watch some TV. If the chair you have doesn't really let you do
    this, standing on the lead will work too but won't be as easy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure the lead isn't so tight, and that it doesn't pull uncomfortably on
    Shadow. However, it should be short enough that he can’t wander off any more
    than half a meter from the chair.
  </li>
  <li>
    While you watch some Doctor Who, give Shadow the stuffed chew toy, so he has
    something interesting to do.
  </li>
  <li>
    Continue to watch TV for 10 minutes after Shadow has finished emptying the
    chew toy.
  </li>
  <li>
    He might do several different things - continue chewing, stay awake and
    alert, or go to sleep. Anything he does is fine!
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Don’t worry about what Shadow is doing. Ideally, he will lie down, but he
    can still stand or move around.
  </li>
  <li>
    In this exercise, you are teaching him that sometimes, he will just be
    settling beside you...and that it can still be quite fun!
  </li>
</ul>
