<h1>Lead Walking - Part 4</h1>
<p>
  In this lesson, you'll be teaching Shadow to walk on a loose lead in the
  garden. This is training for you as well as for Shadow ðŸ˜Š Leadwalking is a
  process that can be frustrating at times; if Shadow isn't ready for the garden
  yet, go to the library and practise earlier lessons.

<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Tasty high-value treats</li>
  <li>Treat pouch</li>
  <li>2m Training Lead</li>
  <li>Harness</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Put the harness and lead on Shadow and go into the garden.</li>
  <li>Hold a treat in your left hand at the top of your left thigh.</li>
  <li>Walk forward normally, with Shadow walking beside you.</li>
  <li>
    If Shadow gets ahead of you or pulls the lead tight, simply stop! No need to
    pull on the lead. Instead, use your enthusiastic voice and yummy treats to
    let Shadow come back to you.
  </li>
  <li>Carry on walking after he comes back, and reward him every 6 steps.</li>
  <li>Slowly build up to walking 12 steps.</li>
  <li>
    Vary your speed and direction. You can make this a fun game now that you are
    outside and have more space.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    You will be doing lead walking a LOT with Shadow, not just when youâ€™re
    training, so itâ€™s important you spend the time on this.
  </li>
  <li>
    Always stop if the lead goes tight! Remember not to be tempted to pull or
    yank.
  </li>
  <li>
    Try to avoid him pulling on the lead from the moment you put it on Shadow.
  </li>
  <li>Be enthusiastic! It will help get his attention.</li>
  <li>
    Remember that walking on a loose lead is difficult for a puppy. Everything
    is just so exciting and distracting! All you need is patience and
    consistency â€“ the rest will follow ðŸ˜Š
