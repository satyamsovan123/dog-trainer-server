<h1>Sit Part 2</h1>

<p>
  Let’s take Sit to the next level and really start communicating what we’d like
  Shadow to do! If you’re not quite ready, then pop back to the library and get
  Shadow familiar with the previous Sit lesson.
</p>

<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Treat Pouch</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Show Shadow you have a treat and get him interested in it to get his
    attention.
  </li>
  <li>Stand up straight.</li>
  <li>
    Rather than luring Shadow with the treat, hold it in your closed hand, close
    to your body at waist height.
  </li>
  <li>
    Wait, and be patient. Remember that you’re asking Shadow to do something
    new, so he needs a bit of time to think about it.
  </li>
  <li>
    After practicing the sit previously, Shadow knows that putting his bottom on
    the ground earns him a treat, so eventually he’ll try it.
  </li>
  <li>The instant he sits, say your marker word (“Good”).</li>
  <li>
    Give Shadow the treat by dropping it on the floor. He has to get up to get
    it, this way he is ready to do it again.
  </li>
  <li>Practice this up to 3 times a day for about 2-3 minutes each time.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    If Shadow tries to jump up to get the treat, move a step back and start
    again.
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose a time to train when Shadow is hungry, not straight after a meal.
  </li>
  <li>Use tiny treats, so he doesn’t get full - or chubby.</li>
  <li>
    Make sure there are no distractions because you need Shadow's full attention
    and focus.
  </li>
  <li>If Shadow seems to lose his concentration, let him wander off.</li>
  <li>
    Puppies only have a short attention span, so later on you can try getting
    him interested in the treat and have another go.
  </li>
  <li>Never get impatient with Shadow or push his bottom down.</li>
  <li>Training is about patience and communication, not force!</li>
</ul>
