<h1>Follow me - Part 1</h1>
<p>
  This task will help keep Shadow focussed on you. It does wonders for improving
  your recall, bonding, and building his confidence as he gets used to having
  distance between you.
</p>
<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Treat pouch</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    First, practise a couple of "sits" to get Shadow’s focus, rewarding each one
    with a treat.
  </li>
  <li>
    After you have done a couple, throw the treat a little farther away so that
    Shadow will have to go and get it.
  </li>
  <li>As Shadow is eating the treat, move a few steps away.</li>
  <li>Now, he must come further to get back to you.</li>
  <li>
    Keep repeating this cycle - ask for the sit, throw the reward, and move a
    few steps away. Increase the distance you move away a little more each time
    to keep it interesting and sharpen his following skills!
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Be enthusiastic! It will help a great deal.</li>
  <li>
    Don’t go too far from Shadow to start with...don't want to make it too
    challenging for him.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don’t move until Shadow is eating the treat. You don’t want him to have to
    choose between going to get the treat and following you...the ultimate
    confusion.
  </li>
  <li>
    When you know that Shadow is enjoying this new game, start to run away a
    little bit. It will make it even more exciting and make you the best
    companion!
  </li>
</ul>
