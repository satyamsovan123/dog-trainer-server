<h1>Being alone Part 4</h1>
<p>
  Dogs love to be with us. They are always happy to be involved in everything we
  do and follow us around. But for Shadow to be confident, he will need to learn
  how to stay on his own sometimes, and that it's completely safe. We’ll be
  building up to 10 minutes in this lesson - if your puppy isn’t ready for this,
  pop back and review previous lessons in the library. Teaching your puppy to be
  left alone should be a very gradual process. It's a tricky thing for puppies,
  in general, but you’ve already made an amazing start.

<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Stuffed Kong toy</li>
  <li>Audio or Video recorder</li>
  <li>Baby Gate</li>
  <li>Enrichment Games</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Stuff a Kong with some treats that will take Shadow some time to empty, and
    put it down in the room where you will be leaving Shadow. Then, scatter
    around 20 treats around the floor for him to hunt.
  </li>
  <li>Leave the room using the baby gate as before.</li>
  <li>
    The video or audio recorder will let you see how Shadow is feeling after
    being left - especially after he has finished the treats.
  </li>
  <li>
    Over the course of the next few days, you'll aim to build this up to 10
    minutes - but do it very gradually! Each time you leave Shadow, go to a
    different room or even outside into the garden.
  </li>
  <li>
    To help Shadow get even more used to you leaving over the next few weeks,
    use the baby gates to stop Shadow following you everywhere.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Go slowly with this. For Shadow to be comfortable being left alone, what it
    will often come down to is confidence, and this will take time to learn!
  </li>
  <li>
    You don't want to create any separation issues as Shadow, being a German
    Shepherd Dog, is the kind of breed that bonds very closely to their owner.
    So, being left alone is often more difficult for them than other breeds. By
    taking it slowly and avoiding any stress, Shadow's confidence will build
    soon enough!
  </li>
  <li>
    Filming Shadow will let you know what he does when you leave, and ultimately
    whether you should move on, or go back over earlier steps.
  </li>
  <li>
    If Shadow looks worried or at all anxious at being left, don’t worry. Just
    go back to the previous lessons in the library and take it more slowly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Moving at Shadow’s own speed is critical when it comes to being left alone.
  </li>
</ul>
