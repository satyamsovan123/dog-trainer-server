<h1>Settle Part 2</h1>
<p>
  In this lesson, we’ll be asking him to settle for longer in various places.
  Perfect practise for Sundays at the pub! If he hasn’t quite mastered settling
  for short periods, pop back to the library and practise the previous lesson to
  build it up gradually.

<h4>You will need</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Stuffed chew toy</li>
  <li>2m Training Lead</li>
  <li>Harness</li>
  <li>Vet bed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Have your piece of vetbed, or something cosy for Shadow to lay on beside the
    chair.
  </li>
  <li>Put on Shadow’s harness before you start and attach the lead to it.</li>
  <li>Then, sit down and attach the lead to the leg of the chair.</li>
  <li>
    The lead shouldn’t be tight, but it should be short enough that he can’t
    wander off more than half a metre from the chair.
  </li>
  <li>
    Give Shadow the Kong toy, so he has something interesting to do while you
    sit on the chair. Read a book, watch some telly, stare at the wall...do
    whatever you like.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stay for a little while longer after Shadow has finished emptying the Kong.
  </li>
  <li>
    At that point, he may continue chewing, stay awake and alert, or go to
    sleep. Anything he does is fine. Well done!
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Tips</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    When you try this exercise in a new room, start off by only doing it for 5
    minutes so Shadow gets used to it.
  </li>
  <li>
    You may want to, but don’t be tempted to tell Shadow what to do. This
    exercise is about him choosing how to settle quietly beside you. As you can
    see, this is also a great exercise to practise self-control. For both of
    you!
  </li>
  <li>
    You can also go ahead and try this out in the garden. This is brilliant
    preparation for Shadow settling when you are out and about.
  </li>
  <li>Exciting times for new adventures are getting closer and closer!</li>
</ul>
