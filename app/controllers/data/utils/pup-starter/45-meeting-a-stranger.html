<h1>Meeting a Stranger - Introducing Shadow</h1>
<p>
  Now that Shadow has begun to meet new people, it's time to introduce him to
  slightly stranger people!
</p>
<p>
  No, this doesn't mean you'll be presenting Shadow with strange people per se -
  just people of all shapes and sizes so that eventually, when he takes on the
  street, he will be able to greet them nicely without feeling uneasy or wary.
</p>
<p>
  Before you ask people to help with this, make sure you try this at home first
  with Shadow in the house and dress up in different outdoor clothing such as a
  hat or a large coat. Make it a fun game! Playing dress up is always lots of
  fun, so make it fun for Shadow too.
</p>
<p>
  Once you've done this a few times at home yourself, you can now ask friends
  and family for help. Arrange for them to come to your house to meet Shadow,
  and ask them to bring hats, big coats, wigs, or anything that will change
  their shape along with them.
</p>
<p>
  Ask people to visit one at a time. If Shadow hasn't met them before, ask your
  visitor to sit on the floor and let him come to them and explore and sniff
  them as you have before. Once Shadow is confident with your guest, ask them to
  go out and put on their hat or jacket and repeat the same thing again.
</p>
<p>
  If Shadow is not looking at all worried, your guest can stroke him and give
  him a treat. If Shadow looks at all concerned when your visitor comes back in,
  just ask them to sit down on a chair and ignore him for a while so Shadow can
  get used to them from a distance. Whenever he is ready, he will slowly come to
  say hello!

<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    As always, the choice to approach and interact with new people should be
    Shadows. The aim of this is for Shadow to learn that people can look
    different, but they are still not scary, so it's really important to let
    Shadow go at his own pace with this one. Remember - pulling him up to the
    'scary thing' to show him it's not scary never works!
  </li>
  <li>
    A good thing to consider is that dogs look at outlines and not details - so
    someone in a hat will look very different to Shadow. Don't be surprised if
    it takes him a few minutes to realise it's the same person! He will get the
    idea quicker than you think.
