<h1>Introducing the Collar & Harness</h1>
<p>
  The time is almost here for taking Shadow out for walks! Better start getting
  ready, so let's get Shadow used to wearing a harness & his collar. We'll start
  by getting Shadow used to the harness as this will usually take a little
  longer for him to feel comfortable with.

<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>2m Training Lead</li>
  <li>Harness</li>
  <li>Collar</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Start by just letting Shadow sniff and investigate the harness. It is
    funny-looking after all!
  </li>
  <li>
    Drape the harness over his back for a few seconds, and then give him a few
    treats.
  </li>
  <li>Have another go, but this time lengthen the time it is on his back.</li>
  <li>
    Encourage him to put his head through the harness, and reward when he does.
  </li>
  <li>
    When Shadow is happy completing these steps, fasten the harness gently. Make
    sure to give him a handful of treats, and then you can take the harness off
    again.
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep going 3 more times and always reward Shadow when the harness is on!
  </li>
  <li>
    You can follow these steps to get Shadow used to wearing their collar as
    well, simply drape the collar around his neck for a few seconds, then give
    him a treat.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once he is comfortable with that, try doing the collar up for a few seconds.
    Remember to be careful and avoid catching any fur in the clip.
  </li>
  <li>Give him a few tasty treats, then take the collar off again.</li>
  <li>Repeat this 3 more times.</li>
  <li>
    Gradually build up the amount of time that Shadow has the collar on for. It
    is normal for some pups to scratch at the collar while they are first
    getting used to it, so take it slow and steady and Shadow will be used to it
    before you even know it!
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    No need to rush this lesson as it's better if you take this one slowly.
    After all, your goal is for Shadow to enjoy having the harness put on.
  </li>
  <li>
    It's better to not adjust the harness or the collar while it is on Shadow
    since tugging and pulling the harness around can be uncomfortable for him.
    So make sure you adjust it before putting it on.
  </li>
  <li>
    And donâ€™t forget, rewarding with treats and praise works very well for
    helping Shadow associate new things with a positive experience.
