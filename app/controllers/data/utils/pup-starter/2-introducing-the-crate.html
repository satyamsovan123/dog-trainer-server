<h1>Introducing the crate</h1>
<p>
  A crate (or a small puppy pen) will be a lifesaver in Shadow’s toilet and
  sleep training. Make sure you introduce it properly to him, so he comes to see
  it as a comfortable and safe place to be in. Don’t worry if it takes a while
  for Shadow to get used to the crate, he will come around sooner than you know.

<h2>You will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Soft Treats</li>
  <li>Toys</li>
  <li>Crate or Playpen</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Introduce Shadow to the crate, keeping the door open.</li>
  <li>
    Encourage him to go into the crate, possibly by chasing a toy, or a tasty
    titbit. Never force him in though! We promise you, this won’t work.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don’t shut the door! Use this time to just let him feel comfortable going
    inside at his own pace.
  </li>
  <li>
    A good tip is to feed Shadow his meals in the crate, and stay beside him to
    keep them company!
  </li>
  <li>
    Whenever Shadow is sleepy, put him in the crate beside you. This way he gets
    used to going in his cozy den every time he wants to sleep.
  </li>
  <li>Remember to keep the door open during this introductory phase.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Put a few treats and toys into the crate, it’s a good way to get Shadow to
    investigate it.
  </li>
  <li>
    It's not a good idea to disturb Shadow when he is in the crate. Make this a
    hard and fast rule with everyone in the family. The crate is going to be
    Shadow’s sanctuary, so it’s important that it feels that way to him.
  </li>
  <li>
    Having 2 crates will make your life easier. One in your living room, and one
    in the bedroom should do the trick.
  </li>
  <li>Remember to keep the door open during this introductory phase.</li>
