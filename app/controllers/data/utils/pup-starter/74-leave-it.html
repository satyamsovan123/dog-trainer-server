<h1>Teaching 'Leave It'</h1>

<p>
  Puppies are curious and like to check everything out. That’s how they learn
  best, after all. However, there’s some things you’d rather they didn’t get
  involved with and times when you wish they’d leave things alone and come away
  from them.
</p>

<p>
  ‘Leave it’ is a really good exercise of self-control, as it also helps your
  puppy to work through their frustration. There's a lot of problem-solving
  skills going on here as they work out what gets them the treats.
</p>

<p>
  It’s a great cue to have in your vocabulary for when you feel like you want to
  say ‘no’ because it just works in the same way, but instead of sounding
  negative, it gives your puppy a better choice to make: ‘leave that and do this
  instead’.
</p>

<p>
  Essentially, ‘leave it’ works to interrupt a behavior you don’t want. It could
  be something like this: ‘Leave that dog you’re staring at’, and teach them to
  disengage or look away, or ‘leave that pile of fox poo’ and come here instead.

  <li>Don’t rush this one! Patience now will pay off in dividends later.</li>
  <li>
    We don’t want them to ever take the food from your hand or the floor, so go
    slowly and methodically so they learn that ‘leaving it’ is a good thing to
    do.
