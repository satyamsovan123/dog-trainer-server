<h1>Exploring surfaces</h1>
<p>
  Puppies learn how to interact in the world best by exploring and discovering
  everything around them. For us, that means that by giving them safe and fun
  things to walk on, climb over, and investigate, we can help their development
  process, and build their confidence. It's a team job!
</p>

<p>
  Like before, you are now going to set up a puppy exploration course with
  different surfaces on the floor. This time, however, add other items such as a
  big box, some smaller cardboard boxes or tubes, a bucket on its side, some
  plastic plant pots, an old metal pan, a knotted thick cotton rope… anything
  that would seem like an interesting thing to explore to Shadow. Something
  different, and safe.
</p>

<p>
  If you can add something Shadow can stand on to get a different height - such
  as a low box or an aerobic step - it would be ideal! Unleash your creativity…
  even a fan gently blowing over the pages of a magazine can be an intriguing
  thing for him to explore.
</p>

<p>
  Hide treats and toys inside or around some of the objects, so there are plenty
  of surprises to discover. You can let Shadow play as long as he wants to - he
  is free to explore them in any way he wants to - sniffing, walking on them,
  climbing on them…prepare to be surprised by what they do!
</p>

<p>
  This is all about gaining confidence, so it's the perfect time to let Shadow
  do whatever he wants in his own time.
</p>

<p>
  Some pups are really confident from the start and can’t wait to explore, while
  others can take more time. Either are alright! Remember to be patient and to
  stay close to your puppy, so their confidence grows bigger simply for having
  you there. Oh, and a little voice encouragement will always be well received
  by them.
</p>

<p>
  Over the next few weeks, you can do this anytime you want to and really have
  fun with it.
