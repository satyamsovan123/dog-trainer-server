<h1>Meeting New People</h1>

<p>
  Now that Shadow has settled into his new home and has met the whole family, he
  can begin to meet new people! So - let's get to it!
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    First, arrange for friends or family to come to meet Shadow at home if
    that's possible - this can always be in the garden to start with.
  </li>
  <li>
    If they have dogs, make sure you know their vaccination status, as they
    could carry infections. We want to make sure that Shadow is always safe!
  </li>
  <li>
    Invite your guests over to your house 1 or 2 at a time so that Shadow
    doesn't get overwhelmed by lots of people.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure everyone knows not to grab or hug Shadow (no matter how tempting
    it is).
  </li>
  <li>
    Get your guest to sit on the floor and let Shadow come to them at their own
    pace. He might explore and sniff around.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure Shadow is happy and confident with your guest. After it's clear he
    is happy, your guest can go ahead and stroke him. Let your guest give him a
    treat or play a gentle game with him.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>
  Within the next couple of weeks, aim to get as many diverse people as possible
  to visit. Try to at least have these include women, men, and children.
</p>
<p>
  One of the key people to introduce Shadow to is your fellow postal delivery
  person. These are important people to make friends with! Ask them if they will
  drop a treat on the floor for Shadow every day they visit - or even give him
  the treat by hand if Shadow is happy to approach them.
</p>
<p>
  If Shadow seems at all worried or concerned about postal workers, continue his
  socialization with new people, but we also recommend putting a postbox at the
  gate, so they don't have to come all the way to the door, and you can keep an
  eye on all the social interactions Shadow has with new people.
</p>
<p>
  As always, remember that the choice to approach and interact with people
  should be Shadow's - the aim of this is for Shadow to learn to be social and
  happy with unknown people, so it’s much easier if Shadow is feeling happy and
  confident.
</p>
<p>
  Another good tip is only to welcome visitors that you know will do what you
  ask them to! You don’t want anyone making Shadow feel confused or unsure.
