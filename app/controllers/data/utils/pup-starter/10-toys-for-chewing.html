<h1>Toys for chewing</h1>
<p>
  You may have noticed, puppies need to chew! and this is just a part of their
  natural instinct as German Shepherd Dogs. As they grow into their adult teeth,
  this will continue to be a big part of their development, so it's important to
  give them safe and appropriate things to chew on to prevent them chewing your
  things!

  Giving Shadow toys to chew during these teething days will be a great way to
  help him find some relief, while saving your shoes and furniture from having a
  short lifespan.
</p>
<p>Wondering what chewable toys are best to give him? Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Long soft tug toys are great. They give a good distance between those needle
    teeth and our hands, whilst being gentle on our puppy's sore gums.
  </li>
  <li>
    Kong toys are ideal as well. They are incredibly long-lasting and can be
    stuffed with food to keep them busy for hours - something you will find very
    useful in more training soon.
  </li>
  <li>
    Frozen chew toys (especially with treats inside) are great to give them
    something crunchy to chew on and soothe those gums.
  </li>
  <li>
    Buffalo Horns and Yak Chews will also do the trick. These are a hit for
    puppies!
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Make sure you keep a close eye on Shadow whenever he is playing with toys, and
  to always buy the right size toy for Shadow. Toys that are too small could be
  dangerous and if they're too big, he won't be able to manage them.

<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>
  Kong toys have a size guide on their website, so you can tell which size will
  suit your puppy.
